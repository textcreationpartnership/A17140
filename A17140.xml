            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Majeſties</hi> BENCH.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a true ſaying of the Philoſopher (Right Honourable, and my very good Lord) that there is nothing wherin there is life, but it hath either motion or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſuch is the condition of man, that a greater meaſure of both is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon him, to humble him, than vpon many other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: The whole courſe of his life being compared vnto a Pilgrimage, in which ſtate a man can preſume vpon no certaine continuance. For as a Traueller that intendeth to finiſh his journey, ſtaies not in his Inne, but deſires more to be vpon his way, than in his bed: ſo it is with man, who cannot poſſeſſe himſelfe in reſt, from the time of his birth vntill his death, and oftentimes is troubled with needleſſe, and vnprofitable Labours, to attaine vnto his ends; which got, both they and he, periſh. Let <hi>Alexander</hi> that great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, be a preſident of this; who with much Labour, hauing got a great eſtate, enjoyed it but a ſhort time: and you may reade in this Treatiſe, with what intollerable paines <hi>Antigonus Epiphanes</hi> endeauoured to eſtabliſh his
<pb facs="tcp:7153:3"/> kingdome to him; and yet in the end purchaſed little but a lamentable death. There is none of the Patriarchs, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Iudges, Kings. Prophets, Apoſtles, or others mentioned in the Scriptures, that could make euident in the whole courſe of their life, any better than a laborious and tedious Pilgrimage. With what paines did <hi>Abraham</hi> wander from Chaldaea, into the land of Canaan? How was <hi>Moſes</hi> tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Wilderneſſe? almoſt to the loſſe of his ſoule; but abſolutely neuer to come into the promiſed land. And for
<hi>Dauid,</hi> how miſerably liued hee, when he could not truſt his owne friends? this is the ſtate of man, and to ſay truth, he differs in little (beſide reaſon) from other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and that either lockt vp in ſilence, or not expreſt in ſome memorable action, makes him ſo much the more capable of miſery: being onely able to diſtinguiſh of joy and feare. And that theſe things may be the more apparant, I haue endeauoured to collect out of the Works of others, this Treatiſe, wherein is briefly deſcribed the Trauels of all the Prophets, Princes, &amp;c. together with the condition of Cities, Countries, Iſlands and other memorable places, as they are mentioned in the Old and New Teſtaments. All which, that I might expreſſe that dutie which hath a long time lien concealed, I haue wholly dedicated to your LL. ſeruice: humbly intreating your fauourable acceptance of my paines; that ſo being ſhrouded vnder your Ho. prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they may the better withſtand the aduerſe opinions of ſuch as pleaſe to cenſure them.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath alwaies beene held a matter worth note (gentle Reader) euen to the beſt Diuines, to haue the Typographicall deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the townes and places, as they are mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and ſo much the rather, becauſe by comparing the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men with the beginnings and endings of Cities, they might the better vnderſtand the Prophets, and perceiue the wonderfull prouidence of God; who by his omnipotencie ſo diſpoſeth of Eſtates, that ſuch Cities and Nations which haue beene mightie and ruled vpon the earth, with great power, notwithſtanding on a ſudden, and by vnexpected euents, haue beene vtterly ſubuerted and ouerthrowne. Now that theſe things might be more apparant, I haue in as good and briefe a method as I can, gathered out of ſundry Authors, the particular deſcription of the Cities, Townes, and places, as they are mentioned in the Scriptures; where they ſtood, vnder whoſe command, at what time they grew mightie, and how loſt and decayed.</p>
            <p>To this alſo I haue added a particular narration of the Trauels of all the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Princes, Iudges, Kings, Emperours, our bleſſed Sauiour, and his Apoſtles: to what townes they trauelled, what memorable actions they did in thoſe places; with a ſhort Chronologie of the times: that ſo by comparing this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with any text of Scripture, you may perceiue the time when thoſe accidents happened. All which things (I am perſwaded) will proue no leſſe pleaſant than profitable, and will giue a great light to the vnderſtanding of the Bible. But if you queſtion with me, How it is poſſible that I ſhould come to the knowledge of thoſe things, conſidering that Babylon, Niniuey, Ieruſalem, and most of the Cities of the Holy Land, are long ſince waſted and decaied? to this I anſwer; therein conſiſts the greatneſſe of the Trauell, becauſe I haue beene conſtrained to vſe the helpe of many Authors, who amongst other long and learned diſcourſes, haue here and there glanced at the actions that were done in the land of Iudaea: amongſt which are <hi>Strabo, Ierome, de Locis Hebraicis, Plinie, Liuie, Plutarch,</hi> and many others, who haue deſcribed in the actions of the Perſians, Chaldaeans, Graecians, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, the ſtate of the Iewes as it ſtood in thoſe times, with the Deſcription of the Cities, and townes. And Saint
<hi>Ierome,</hi> who liued in that countrie, tooke a great
<pb facs="tcp:7153:4"/> deale of paines to rectifie theſe imperfect diſcourſes which more obſcure authors haue laboured in, and left to future ages; that ſo thoſe which would, might by their dilligence, and care make them vſefull to informe their vnderſtanding, both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſtate of the Iewes, and the obſcure meaning of ſome of the propheſies.</p>
            <p>Alſo the ſcituation and deſtruction of Ieruſalem, a thing pleaſant and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know, and no whit vnworthie your conſideration. How all or the moſt part of the Townes, Cities, Countries, Nations, Iſlands, Seas, Deſarts, Mountaines, and moſt memorable places, are ſcituated from it; how many miles Engliſh they ſtand diſtant, what memorable actions haue beene done in them, and for the moſt part where they ſtood, and how they are at this day.</p>
            <p>Beſides (to make this a perfect worke) you ſhall finde after the end the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and before the beglnning of the new; a diſcourſe concerning the weights, meaſures, and monies which are mentioned in the Scriptures, reduced vnto our valuation, how they were currant among the Iewes, how with other people, nations, and countries: by which meanes that neceſſitie of commutatiue Iustice, for which monies were principally inuented, will be apparent; and by this meanes you ſhall perceiue what equalitie there is and hath beene vſed amongſt Nations, for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of meaſures and monies: by which you may perceiue, that this vniuerſe being compared together, ſeemeth but one large and ſpacious Empire, howſoeuer vnder diuers gouernments.</p>
            <p>Againe, the perigrination of our Sauiour, the manner of his wonderfull natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, his long and tedious journies, the condition of his eſtate whiles he was vpon the earth, and (as neere as can be gueſt) at what time he did moſt of his miracles; how he behaued himſelfe when he was betraied, with a deſcription of the manner of his death: and the Trauels of <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and many other of his Apostles after his death.

               <head>How the Romans meaſured their miles.</head>
               <p>THe Romans meaſured their miles by paces, which they call <hi>Paſſus,</hi> and that kind of meaſuring is done after this maner; Foure barley cornes laid long-waies one by the other make the bredth of a finger, foure fingers broad make the bredth of an hand, foure hands broad make the length of a foot, which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is now extant; fiue feet make a Geometricall or great pace; one hundred twenty fiue ſuch paces are a Furlong; eight Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs are one thouſand paces or Wallon mile; two thouſand pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are a French mile.</p>

                  <l>Eſt quater in palmo digitus, quater in pede palmus,</l>
                  <l>Quinque pedes paſſum faciunt, paſſus quoque centum</l>

               <p>Four thouſand paces are a Dutch mile, I mean a common Dutch mile, whereof fifteen are reckoned to a degree of the heauens; for the Switfer miles are commonly a quarter of a Dutch mile lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than common Dutch miles. But through this book by miles we vnderſtand common Dutch miles, whereof four thouſand pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make a mile.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer will vnderſtand S. <hi>Ierom</hi> wel, <hi>de locis Haebraicis,</hi> muſt mark whether he reckons by miles or by ſtones: the miles ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by him are Wallon miles, whereof four make a Dutch mile as aforeſaid: the ſtone whereof he writeth (wherby alſo they did meaſure and diuide the way) are reckoned ſix to a Dutch mile.</p>
               <p>To the end that all men that haue any little vnderſtanding in Geometry and Coſmography may make the Tables, and caſt them, and at their pleaſure inlarge or diminiſh them; I haue here for their direction ſet downe the longitude and latitude of the moſt principal towns: the former number ſhew the degrees and minutes of the longitude, the later numbers declare the degrees and minutes of the latitude.</p>

               <p>THe Temple ſtood vpon Mount Moriah, was fairely built, &amp; artificially contriued, of white Marble ſtones, which were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7153:10"/> ſo well conjoyned or cloſed together, that a man could not ſee or perceiue the junctures or creſts of them: and the inner Walls of it were made all of Cedar wood, carued with the ſimilitude of Angels, Cherubins, roots of Palme trees, and with floures of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kindes, gilt all ouer with pure gold, and ſet with pretious ſtones; inſomuch that all parts of the vpper roofe within the Temple, did ſhine with the luſtre of it. The pauement thereof alſo was plated all ouer with fine Gold; ſo that all the Temple within, both aboue, vnder foot, and on euery ſide and corner thereof, was gilt cleane ouer: but without it was of ſmooth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht white marble ſtone, excellently beautifull, and faire to the eye,<note place="margin">That is, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred cubits, which make fiftie yards Engliſh; ſo that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was fiftie yards long, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie broad, and ſixtie high.</note> much reſembling the colour of any Pearle, Vnit or Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. It was in length a hundred ells, in breadth a hundred ells, and in height a hundred and twenty ells, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> writeth in the old acts and warres of the Iewes, in his fifteenth booke and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter.</p>
               <p>The roofe thereof was made of thin planks of Oliue wood, all couered ouer with plates of gold: it was adorned with ſharp and plaine ſpikes of gold, leſt birds ſhould defile it with their doung. When any man trauelled to Ieruſalem, and ſaw the temple farre off when the Sunne ſhined thereon, the white marble ſtones and the golden roofe therof; did caſt ſuch a light and reflexing bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from them, that it did make the beholders eyes darke and blind with looking vpon it.</p>
               <p>Within the Temple there was the moſt ſacred Quire, which ſtood at the Weſt end therof, the which Quire was formed foure ſquare, that is, twenty ells broad, long, and high. This Quire was called the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holieſt,</hi> wherein it was lawfull for no man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the high Prieſt, and he alſo but once in a yeare, which was on the Feaſt day of the Propitiatory Sacrifice, to appeaſe Gods wrath. In the middle part of the Quire there ſtood two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, made of Oliue wood, couered all ouer with fine gold, whoſe Faces and Formes were like vnto young Children; the height of them was ten ells; each of them had two wings, which were fiue els broad; they ſtood one right againſt the other, ſo that with the innermoſt wings they touched together, and the vttermoſt ſides of the wings touched the ſides of the Quire: their faces loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7153:10"/> wards the Eaſt: in the middle vnder the wings of the Cherubins was placed the Arke of the Couenant; but after the Babylonian captiuity the Ark of the Couenant ſtood no more there; for then the Holy of holieſt was empty, and nothing ſeene in the ſecond Temple but the two Cherubims, as is aforeſaid. The wall of this Quire was of pure gold, excellent faire and curiouſly grauen: In this wal of the moſt holy quire there was a gate made all of gold which had two leaues or little dores that opened &amp; ſhut, very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly emboſſed; through which dores men went into the moſt holy Quire, where the Lord did anſwer by
<hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> there the Cherubims ſtood, and before that gate there did hang a rich Vaile or Curtain which was made of fine ſilke, wouen very artificially, wherein there was wrought the picture of the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, with Needle-worke of diuers colours. This was the ſame Vaile which at the paſſion of Chriſt did rent in ſunder from the top to the bottom; to ſhew that then <hi>Aarons</hi> Leuiticall Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were aboliſhed, and now euery man may freely approch (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the mercy of his dearly beloued Sonne) vnto the preſence of Gods heauenly Throne.</p>
               <p>Before the moſt ſacred Quire there was builded towards the Eaſt a place within the Temple containing forty Ells in length, twenty in bredth and thirty in height, cloſed vp on both ſides with golden walls, which was called the Holy place or Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Temple, wherein no man might enter but onely the Prieſt, when hee offered Incenſe, and prayed vnto God. In the middle of that Holy place there ſtood an Altar, couered with plates of gold; neere vnto which the Angel
<hi>Gabriel</hi> appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and brought him the glad tydings, That
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> his wife ſhould beare him ſonne whoſe name ſhould be <hi>Iohn,</hi> who ſhould prepare the way of Chriſt. At the South end of this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar vpon the one ſide ſtood the holy Candleſtickes, and at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end on the other ſide ſtood a golden Table whereupon the Shew bread was ſet. And in this holy place there ſtood ten Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles more for the meat Offerings, and ten golden Candleſtickes more, which were beautified with Lamps, Lillies, and other faire floures. The opening doores whereby men went into the Holy place were alſo very rich and coſtly, made of gold, with carued
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7153:11"/> Cherubims, Palm trees, and broad flours thereupon. And before thoſe dores alſo there were hanging vailes or curtaines, very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought. On both ſides of the Temple there were certain Walks or Galleries, which were three ſtories high one aboue an other, and on the right ſide there ſtood a paire of turning ſtaires, by the which men went vp to the Chamber of the Temple, and there all the ſmall Veſſels and other things belonging to the Temple were kept. The roofes of theſe Galleries were all plated ouer with gold, but that part was ſomewhat lower than the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part of the Temple. The Windowes of the Temple were wide within and narrow without. The gates of the Temple were made of pure gold, fiue and twenty Ells high, and ſixteene Ells broad; but eſpecially the gate that ſtood Eaſtward in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was exceeding high, which in the ſecond Booke of <hi>Kings, cap.</hi> 25. is called the High gate: and as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, the ſayd gate was 90 Ells high, the doores whereof were forty Ells long and twenty Ells broad, gilt all ouer, and richly emboſſed, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Cherubims and pretious ſtones. The wall before this gate towards the Eaſt was pure gold, emboſt and curiouſly ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in maner of Vines, with great golden leaues as big as the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a man, whereon there did hang the picture and forme of grapes, which were made of fine Cryſtall. Within that high gate alſo there did hang a Vaile or Curtaine as long and broad as the gate within: This Vaile was made of a piece of Babylonian Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry, wonderfully wrought, and made of Silke, beautified with diuers colours, of Scarlet, Purple, and Velvet; and as
<hi>Ioſephus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, the Sphere of the heauens was wrought therein, but the twelue Signes were not, and when the winde blew, the Vaile did moue like a Vane.</p>

               <p>BEfore the high gate of the Temple towards the Eaſt there were three Porches or Courts open without roofes, which were made all of poliſht ſtone with fair marble pillars, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with all kind of colours, in which Porches men praiſed and ſerued God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:7153:11"/>The firſt was called the vpper Porch, where none but the prieſt might enter when he offered and ſerued God; which porch ſtood next vnto the high Quire. The ſecond was called <hi>Solomons</hi> Hall or Porch; there the people vſed to pray, and in that court our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior Chriſt preached, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. The third porch King <hi>Herod</hi> built, adding that therto for the heathen people which alſo came vnto Ieruſalem to pray.</p>
               <p>Theſe three porches went foure ſquare round about the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the Temple it ſelfe was, and betweene theſe porches there were alſo ſpaces left, ſupported with pillars of marble, and cloſe aboue the head for men to walke vnder when it rained, which were all made of Cedar and Cypreſſe wood, and of marble ſtone beautified with gold. But towards the Eaſt, right ouer againſt the high Quire of the Temple, there the Porches were broadeſt and greateſt.</p>

<hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> King of Babylon, and broken in pieces; after which captiuity they were neuer ſeen more in the Temple, for there were no more made.

In this Court alſo there was a goodly Fountaine, with the Water whereof they vſed to waſh the bloud of the beaſts out of the Temple.

The reſt ſeeing this maſſacre, ſuſpecting treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues, fell one vpon another; and many for feare of loſſe, or to auoid future danger, killed themſelues. In this very place alſo, <hi>Florus</hi> Generall of the common ſouldiers, within few yeares after, vpon a ſmall occaſion, made another cruell maſſacre and much more barbarous than the former: for hee ſpared none, the beſt of them he cauſed to be whipt to death, or elſe crucified and put to the ſword; and for the Vulgar ſpared neither woman nor childe. So that within the compaſſe of one day there died of this obſtinate and wicked Nation aboue ſeuen hundred and thirty.

<hi>Florus,</hi> and vpon her knees beſought him to take ſome mercy and pitty of them, and withdraw his hand of vengeance from the bloud of the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.

<hi>Molochs</hi> burning armes, which he with his armes red hot burnt to death. And in this manner the Iewes offered their owne children to the Idoll <hi>Moloch:</hi> and when they did it, they made a great noiſe &amp; crie, and beat vpon a drum, that the fathers when their children were offered, ſhould not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7153:23"/> here them crie, by reaſon of the great noiſe of Drums. This val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was called the valley of <hi>Tophet;</hi> for <hi>Tophet</hi> ſignifies a Drum. This was a moſt groſſe and fearefull Idolatry, &amp; therefore Chriſt likened this valley of Hinnon to hell fire; for he called it <hi>Gehenna, Mat.</hi> 5. That the Iewes ſhould keepe themſelues from this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Idolatrie, God made a law, That if any man were taken committing this kind of Idolatry, he ſhould forthwith be ſtoned to death, and not ſuffered to liue, <hi>Leuit.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THus haue I briefly ſet forth the dignitie, ſcituation, &amp; curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity of the buildings of Ieruſalem; together with the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Temple, and ſumptuouſneſſe of the houſes: now it reſts to deſcribe vnto you, the manner and meanes how this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Citie was deſtroyed; ſurely a thing worthy wonder (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in <hi>Ieremy) Whoſoeuer ſhall heare of it his eares ſhall tingle.</hi> And that it might be the more famous, and the Chriſtians
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7153:23"/> within it might take notice of the neer approaching deſolation, there were diuers ſtrange accidents hapned, and viſions ſeene. As firſt, about ſome foure yeares before, the riuer Iordan was turned out of her courſe, and was brought into the Citie Pella: a while after that, for a yeare together, there hung a Comet like a flaming ſword ouer the City: And in the night there was ſeene a light in the Temple: And in the day when they were at ſacrifice, a Calfe brought forth a Lambe. Then about the middle of the night, the Eaſterne gates of the Temple opened of their owne accord. In the skies were ſeene armies of men fighting, and Horſes and Chariots running too and againe. And at laſt there was heard a terrible voice in the temple, vttering theſe words, <hi>Migremus hinc;</hi> that is, <hi>Let vs goe hence.</hi> And that there might be a generall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of this ſad and cruell deſolation, through the whole citie, one <hi>Ananias</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> a man poore and impotent, vpon the Feaſt of the Tabernacles, ran through all the ſtreets of the Citie, and crying, <hi>O, a voice from the Eaſt, and a voice from the Weſt, a voice from the foure windes, a voice ouer Ieruſalem and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a voice ouer the Bridegroome and the Bride, and a voice ouer the whole multitude of this Citie.</hi> And although he was whipt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and cruelly handled, yet ſo long as he liued, hee would not ceaſe to vtter theſe words, which by ſome were judg'd to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel the horrible deſolation which after hapned.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Titus Caeſar</hi> ſonne of <hi>Flavius</hi> the Emperor, about ſeuentie yeares after the Natiuitie of our Lord, and about eight and thirty after his aſcenſion, vtterly ouerthrew it euen to the ground, about the firſt day of the moneth of Aprill, and within a yeare after theſe ſignes. For he taking aduantage of the three factions which at this time ſwaied in Ieruſalem: One of <hi>Eleazer</hi> the Prieſt the ſonne of <hi>Simon;</hi> the other of
<hi>Zilotus</hi> the chiefe Prince which held the Temple; and the third of <hi>Iohannes Giſcalenus</hi> a cruell fellow, which had the command of the inferiour Citie; beſieged it, and made this a fit opportunitie to further his enterpriſes, whiles the ſeditious and factious people, little regarding their owne ſafetie, gaue way by their euill and inteſtine warrs, to what he intended, weakning themſelues much more by their continued ſlaughters, than the enemy by his inuaſion. Inſomuch as the whole citie, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7153:24"/> Temple was filled with dead bodies; common inſolencies, and publique rapines were ordinarily amongſt them: ſome ſet fire of the City, others diſpoiling the Temple, a third ſort killing the Prieſts euen as they were at ſacrifice, al places ful of dead bodies; and to this, to adde a greater meaſure of miſerie (without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard at all to their future defence) ſet fire of the ſtore-houſe, wherein the corne lay for the ſuſtentation of the Citie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed that in one day which had been long a gathering: by this meanes it came to paſſe, that they were ſorely afflicted with the peſtilence through the corruption of the aire, and with famine, for want of Corne. All theſe things notwithſtanding (ſuch was the crueltie, obſtinacie, and peruerſeneſſe of this people) could not reſtraine them from violating the moſt ſacred and holy things of the Temple: inſomuch as <hi>Iohannes Giſcalenus</hi> had a full determination to haue deſtroyed it, but that he was preuented by the Romans.</p>
               <p>About this time was the feaſt of the Paſſeouer, and it fell vpon the fourteenth day of Aprill, being the Sabboth; to the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, there reſorted to Ieruſalem, about three hundred thouſand Iewes. Theſe the enemy gaue way to enter into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; but conſidering their preſent neceſſitie for want of victuals, vpon a ſuddain drew vp their forces, and ſo ſtraightly beleagered them that all this huge multitude was (as it were) impriſoned within the wals, where partaking of the former miſery, they either died by the plague or famin. Whence may be perceiued the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous prouidence of God, that euen on the ſame day, and in the very ſame place, where but eight and thirtie yeares before our Sauiour Chriſt ſuffered, the authors of ſuch crueltie ſuffered a moſt juſt and ſeuere reuenge, Now as the army of the Romans lay vpon the North of the Citie, <hi>Titus</hi> drew out a band of ſix hundred horſe to ride about, to behold and view the walls of the Towne: but as he was in this manner wondring at the ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the Citie, the Iewes in great multitudes ſlipt out at a poſterne gate, and ſet vpon him ſo fiercely, that they endangered his perſon, being without armour; and had he not with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie broke through them, and recouered the Tower of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, hee had beene there ſlaine. But preſently vpon this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7153:24"/> the danger, hee beſieged the Citie in three parts; himſelfe as the Emperour of the armie, built a caſtle about ſome two fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs from the Citie, iuſt againſt the Tower Pſephina. Thc other part of the army was intrenched right againſt the Tower Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picus not farre from the Garden of the reſurrection. And the third part had their Caſtle in the Mount of Oliues, ſome fiue fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs or thereabouts from the Citie. Then did hee build Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes, make Engines, and wonderfull deuiſes, for the battering of the Walls; and combining himſelfe with ſome of the Iewes, vpon the ſeuenth day of the ſecond moneth, which anſwereth to the moneth of May, with great difficultie and much labour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the firſt Wall which lay vpon the North, and woon Mount Bezitha and Neapolie. Vpon the twelfth of the ſame moneth (which was the Sabboth day) hee entred the ſecond wall, which diuided the ſuburbs: but this was againe the ſame day recouered by the vertue of the Iewes, ſo that the Iewes were conſtrained to fight vpon the Sabboth day, according to the prophecie of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. But after vpon the ſixteenth of this moneth of May, the Romans againe recouered this wall and kept it in their owne cuſtody.</p>
               <p>Within a while after in the month of Iune (about this time the famine growing intollerable within the towne) <hi>Titus</hi> in the ſpace of three daies, compaſſed in the whole citie of Ieruſalem with a Wall, and vpon that ſet Towers and Caſtles, leſt any of the Iewes ſhould flye to ſaue themſelues. Thus was the prophecie of our Sauiour Chriſt fulfilled, <hi>Thy enemies ſhall compaſſe thee about and hem thee in on euery ſide. Ioſephus</hi> was now in the Citie, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon the Walls, earneſtly intreated the Iewes to deſiſt, and no longer to oppoſe the Romans, but this was ſo hatefull a ſpeech to many, that they began to fling darts at him. And although at this time the extremitie of the famine was ſo ſore, that many dyed for want of ſuſtenance, yet all perſwaſions were in vaine; and ſuch was the calamitie, that as well thoſe as went out, as thoſe that continued in the Citie, were in like danger of their liues; for they were either ſlaine by the enemy, or els by the peſtilence and famine; common injuries, and vnmercifull outrages ſtill atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon warre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:7153:25"/>Their miſery did rather increaſe, then at all leſſon it ſelfe; for the jealouſie of treaſon, the hope of riches, and the madnes of the ſeditious, diſtracted the mindes of the Citizens with continuall feares, and filled the ſtreets full of murther and daily ſpectacles of lamentable tragedies: The markets were vnfrequented with Corne, the victuals, with violence conſumed and taken from the true owners. And if it chanced that ſome one had more than would ſerue his turne, though he dwelt in a faire and ſtately buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, yet the remoteſt roome and moſt vnfrequented he made his tabernacle, and that little which was left, with great parcimonie he conſumed, together with his life, till both were ended. Thoſe that were Fathers and Senats of the people (though before ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and attended with reuerenced and great ſtate) in this conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was glad of a ſmall morſell, though with much contention. The wife was not aſhamed to take away the meate from her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, nor the children from their parents, nor the mothers from their infants: And if it hapned that in any houſe the ſeditious ſeemed to ſmell food, with violence they tooke it, ranſackt the roomes round about, whiles the maſter therof was made a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtocke and mournfull ſpectator of thoſe miſchiefes. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the condition of ſouldiers, whoſe naturall diſpoſition is to be violent, without any regard either of ſex or kindred, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted daily outrages. So that here you might haue ſeene the mothers weeping ouer their dying infants, whiles their husbands were maſſacred in the ſtreets by the ſeditious.</p>
               <p>The increaſe of daies were the increaſe of torments, and the daily want of ſuch as were in power being vnaccuſtomed to ſuch euils, cauſed them to inuent new meanes to ſatisfie their deſire, and practiſe vnuſuall torments, for no other purpoſe but to finde out ſuſtenance: yea, ſuch was their inſatiable thirſt of bloud, that they ſpared not him whom but now gaue them all hee had, and leaſt he ſhould liue to cumber the city, either hang him vp by the heeles till he died, or elſe pulled out his entrailes with a ſharpe yron. Thoſe that went out in the night time when the Romans were aſleepe, to gather herbes, the ſeditious would meet and with violence take what they had got from them: and though with teares and lamentations, and prayers vpon their knees, they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7153:25"/> intreated but for one part, a ſmall moitie of that which a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had got with danger of their liues, yet they would not giue it them, and ſcap't fairely if they went away with life. Theſe inſolencies were committed by the common ſouldiers, vpon ſuch as were of the meaner ſort of people. But for the reſt that were either honorable or rich, they became a prey to the Captains and Commanders, ſome accuſed as traitors, and that they would haue betraied the Citie to the Romans; others as fugitiues, that they would forſake the Citie; moſt vnder pretence of one crime or other, diſpoiled of that they had. And they whom
<hi>Iohn</hi> had thus oppreſſed, were entertained of <hi>Simon,</hi> and whom <hi>Simon</hi> had inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, they were entertained by <hi>Iohn;</hi> both drunke the bloud of the miſerable Citizens like water: So that the deſire of rule was the cauſe of their diſſention, the concord of their euill and cruell actions.</p>
               <p>There was an infinite number that periſhed in this citie by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, inſomuch as houſes were filled with the bodies of infants and children. The Angle gate was thruſt full of dead corpes. The young men that remained, walked vp and downe the Citie like Images of death. The old men were deſtroyed by the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the contagion of which diſeaſe taking away their ſenſes, they became madde. And of ſuch as died among the ſeditious, their wiues or kindred had not roome nor time to bury them, but as they were putting them into the graue they alſo dyed. Yet for all this, amongſt this miſerable ſocietie, there was no weeping, no complaining, no deploring of their neceſſities, for the violence of the famin hauing dried vp their radical moiſture, the feare of griefe was taken from them: and ſuch as had moſt cauſe to lament, and were moſt pricked with the ſting of ſorrow, before they could vtter their griefe died, the beholders not ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a tear: ſo that through the whole city there was a ſtill ſilence, and a thicke miſt of death, and deſtruction did fully poſſeſſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>But the ſeditious were much more cruell than theſe were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with calamitie and ſorrow; for ſome opened the graues of the dead, and taking out their bodies thruſt them thorow with their ſwords. Others to trie the ſharpeneſſe of the edge of their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7153:26"/> weapons would fall vpon thoſe that were yet aliue, and when they had ſlaine them, goe away laughing at their pleaſure. So that as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, there was ſcarce any miſchiefe vnder the Sunne, but was both practiſed and tollerated in this Citie. To conclude, by ſedition the Romans conquered the Citie, and ſedition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the Romans.</p>
               <p>All loue and modeſtie, through this extreme and intollerable famine, became vtterly extinct, and the deereſt friends would kill one another for a cruſt of bread; the faireſt Lady commit open adultery for a little ſuſtinance. Their food was extraordinary, and ſuch as men did loath and hate: Some would feed vpon ſnailes and wormes, others of old hay chopt ſmall; many ate corne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnground or made into bread: ſome pluckt the meat from the ſpit raw, others with their teeth gnaud off the leather off their ſhields: And that very mouth which cried,
<hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him, let his bloud be vpon vs and our children,</hi> was conſtrained to feed vpon three ſorts of dung, that is to ſay, Doues dung, Oxens dung, and Mans dung. Moreouer, many were conſtrained for meere neceſſitie, to feed vpon the dead bodies of ſuch, as a little before dyed, partly by famine, partly by the peſtilence. And to conclude, for very madneſſe eat vp their gold: for ſome of them being taken as they were flying for their ſafety by the Romans, in their excrement was found gold, of which the ſouldiers hearing, and ſuppoſing that all the Iewes had beene full of gold, thorow couetouſneſſe of that gaine, in one night killed 2000 of them, and ript vp their bellies; And had not <hi>Titus Caeſar</hi> by a ſeuere Edict, forbidden theſe cruell and vnheard of ſlaughters, there had beene many more ſlaine.</p>
               <p>To make an end of this vnheard of famine, I will repeat one memorable example our of
<hi>Ioſephus,</hi> of an outrage which a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed euen vpon her owne ſonne. There was a woman of the inhabitants beyond Iordan, whoſe name was <hi>Marie,</hi> of the ſtocke of
<hi>Eliazer,</hi> and of the Towne Bethezor, which ſignifies the houſe of Hiſſop; ſhee was of a noble and rich family, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, went to Ieruſalem in hope of ſafety, where ſhe was likewiſe oppreſſed with the miſerie of this ſiege; for as ſoone as ſhe had brought all her riches and ſubſtance into the City, which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7153:26"/> ſhe had before beyond Iordan, this famine growing greater and greater vpon the inhabitants. The ſeditious perceiuing that this woman was well furniſhed both with riches and ſuſtinance, on a ſuddain ſet vpon her houſe, diſpoiled her of her ſubſtance, tooke away her ſuſtinance, and vtterly depriued her of all meanes to liue. Shee beeing pricked with the miſery and calamitie of the times, ſaw it little preuailed to ſtriue, wherefore with teares, vpon her knees ſhe intreated that ſhee might haue but ſome ſmall part of that they had taken from her, to maintain her ſelfe and her ſon with life; but the ſeditious gaue little eare to her intreaties: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being mooued to extreme anger ſhe daily curſed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious words thoſe barbarous villains, that had thus rob'd her of all her means: but when ſhee ſaw that neither anger nor intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie could procure mercie, and through the Towne not one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of food was to be found, partly preſt with an extreame neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, partly with a furious rage, beyond all nature and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, laid violent hands vpon her owne ſonne, and accounted an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death more honourable, than that he ſhould liue to bee a prey to the ſeditious, or a ſlaue to the Romans.</p>
               <p>The body of this infant ſhee roſted and eat: the ſoldiers of the Towne beeing preſt with hunger, ſmelling the meat, ſuppoſing that as in former times, they ſhould haue found plenty, with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence broke in vpon her, and looke what ſhe had prouided greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſumed, and compelled her to fetch the reſt; which ſhee did, and when they were well ſatisfied, ſhe ſhewed them the head and feet of her ſonne: which they perceiuing, loathing the inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the fact, with dejected countenance departed. This famine was ſo extreame, that one meaſure of graine was worth a talent, that is, 600 crownes. But the Romans all this while did abound with plenty of all things, and to vex the Iewes they ſhewed them the great aboundance of their ſtore, for the neighboring prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſent them ſupplies.</p>
               <p>After this famine, there followed an extreme plague, procured partly through the ſtanch of the bodies that lay vnburied, partly by the multitude of the maſſacres that daily hapned, that (as
<hi>Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus</hi> writeth) within the compaſſe of eleuen weekes, there were carried out by one gate of the Citie, 111000 dead bodies; yet
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7153:27"/> could they not emptie the Citie, but that they were conſtrained either to bury them at the publike charge, or elſe caſt them ouer the wals into the ditches of the citie: which when <hi>Titus</hi> ſaw, and that the putrifaction of the bodies ſwam vpon the brim of the ditch (for it was full with dead carkaſſes) fetching a deepe ſigh, and lifting vp his hands to heauen, he ſaid, God is my witnes, this is not my fault, but the puniſhment of God vpon them.</p>
               <p>The city being thus peſtired with ſedition, famine, peſtilence, and warre, was made now a ready prey to the Enemy: and that they might make a finall end of their miſeries, <hi>Titus</hi> cauſed the engines of batterie to be brought againſt the walls; and vpon the firſt day of the fourth month (whicn anſwers to our Iune) he took the third wall which lay vpon the North. Vpon the fourth of Iune after, though with great labour, he tooke the Tower of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia, and in it placed a Garriſon. Vpon the ſeuenteenth day of the fourth moneth, which was a faſt to the Iewes, <hi>Ioſephus</hi> going vp to the top of that Tower, made an Oration to
<hi>Giſcalinus</hi> and the reſt, to diſſwade them from their rebellion, &amp; ceaſe to oppoſe the Romans, but this little preuailed. Vpon the twentieth day of Iuly, the Iewes burnt a part of the Porch of the Temple towards the North, not far from the Tower of Antonia, leſt that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hauing got that Hold, ſhould with the greater facilitie haue conquered the Temple alſo. Two daies after, the Romans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the whole Porch with fire, and the Iewes helpt to pull it downe with their hands: this was none of the three Porches but a bulwarke of the Temple. Vpon the 25 day of Iuly the Iewes filled the Porch toward the Weſt with pitch and betume, and then made as though they meant to fly and leaue the citie, which ſome of the Romans perceiuing, without any command of their Captaines, put ſcaling ladders to the Tower, and began to aſſault it, but when they were moſt buſie, the Iewes of a ſudden put fire to the pitch, and burnt them moſt miſerably; inſomuch as <hi>Titus</hi> pittied them to ſee their extremitie, although they were ſuch as did contrary to his command. Vpon the laſt day of this moneth they tooke the North gate, which lay towards the riſing of the Sunne, and cloſe by the brooke Cedron; rhis they burnt downe with fire. Vpon the third of Auguſt, <hi>Titus</hi> commanded to fire the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7153:27"/> gate of the Temple, that was all couered ouer with gold &amp; ſiluer, by this gate the Romans made a breach into the Temple, which ere this had beene prophaned by the Iewes: whiles this gate was a burning, the Iewes ſtood aſtoniſhed, and not one of them reſiſted the Romans. <hi>Caeſar</hi> and all his army labored three daies to quench this fire, after which hee called a councell to determine what he ſhould do with the temple, it was ſo rich and ſumptuous, that he would faine haue left it as an ornament for the Roman Empire. But the Iewes hauing got a little breathing, made new incurſions vpon the Romans, by which meanes they could not determine thereof. The 6 of Auguſt, the ſouldiers of <hi>Titus,</hi> without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Captaines, fired the Temple, juſt vpon that day which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> before time had deſtroyed it, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>li. de Bell.</hi> 6.
<hi>c.</hi> 26.27. <hi>Caeſar</hi> would faine haue ſaued this Temple for the ſumptuouſneſſe of it, and beckoned to his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to haue quencht the fire, but they, partly preſt on with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of wealth, partly being prickt on with a fury and madneſſe, gaue no eare to his ſpeeches, but committed moſt cruell maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, without either regard of age or ſex: So that the cries of the ſlaughterd, the ſound of the Roman trumpets, the fierce reſiſtance of the ſeditious, and the fire furiouſly burning, repreſented a moſt horrible ſpectacle: The ground below was couered with dead bodies, many in deſperation threw themſelues into the fire, 6000 were burnt in the ſame gate, whither they fled for refuge, and the prieſts moſt cruelly maſſacred as they were in the Temple. This was the end of the Temple of Ieruſalem, the mirror of the world, being conſumed and ſpoiled with fire and ſword.</p>
               <p>After theſe things, vpon the bridge that paſſeth from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ouer the valley into the lower towne, <hi>Titus</hi> made a ſpeech by an interpreter, to the two ſeditious Captaines, gently intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to leaue off their rebellion, and he would ſpare the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and commit no more outrages, and ſuch further requeſts as they deſired ſhould according to reaſon be granted them; but if they would not embrace mercy and ceaſe their violent reſiſtance, they muſt expect no manner of compaſſion, but the very law of Armes. This they contemned and made but a mocke of <hi>Caeſar</hi> for all his offers; whereupon in a great rage hee gaue the ſignall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7153:28"/> to his ſouldiers, and they went through all the City and ſet it on fire. The next day they woon the lower Citie, and with fire and ſword conſumed the place where the records lay, the Court and all the Princely buildings, vntill they came to that ſtately houſe of <hi>Helena,</hi> which ſtood in the midſt of Acra, all the houſes neere being filled with the bodies of the dead, and the ſtreets horribly defiled with the bloud of thoſe that were ſlaine. Within a ſhort while after, <hi>Iohannes Giſcalinus</hi> was taken aliue and committed to priſon.</p>
               <p>The inferiour Citie being thus taken and deſtroyed, about the 16 day of Auguſt,
<hi>Caeſar</hi> began to build his engines, and batter the walls of the vpper citie, which within the ſpace of 18 daies after with extreme labour and skill, hee laid flat with the ground, (as
<hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith.) And vpon the 7 of September, with great facilitie hee conquered the citie, the Iewes of their owne accord deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Towers: and the Romanes ſet vpon the walls their enſignes, with a great acclamation, and waſted all the citie with fire and ſword, ſparing neither men, women, nor children.</p>
               <p>The 8 day of the moneth of September, the whole Citie was deſtroyed, and not a ſtone left vpon a ſtone but laid leuell with the ground, onely the three Towers that were built by
<hi>Herod,</hi> which were of ſhining Marble (<hi>viz.</hi> Hippicus, Phaſelus, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamne) that future ages ſeeing the excellencie of thoſe buildings they might iudge of the ſtatelines of the reſt. But theſe alſo were after deſtroyed by <hi>Adrianus Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There died by the famine and peſtilence an innumerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, by fire and ſword ten hundred thouſand: 2000 were found that either killed themſelues, or one killed another, 7900 were taken captiues; of theſe, all the ſeditious theeues that accuſed one another, were ſlaine by <hi>Frontonius Caeſar, Titus</hi> freed many, 7000 were ſent into Aegypt, with extreme labour to conſume and die, the propereſt and moſt able were reſerued for triumph, many were diſtributed through the prouinces, ſome were ſlaine by the ſword, and by beaſts for publike ſpectacles, and thoſe that were 16 yeares of age and vnder, together with many other, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſold vnder the crowne, at thirty for a ſiluer penny; that as Chriſt was ſold for thirty pence, ſo thirty of them ſhould be ſold for a penny,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7153:28"/> With the riches of this towne <hi>Caeſar</hi> triumphed, rode into Rome with two golden Chariots, built the Temple of Peace, and there put all the plate which he found in the temple of Ieruſalem. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, for a full determination of thoſe euils, the two ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous captaines <hi>Iohannes Giſcalenus</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> the ſon of
<hi>Giora,</hi> were put to moſt cruell deaths. Thus may we ſee the grieuous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the obſtinat and ambitious, which God permitted to fall vpon them for their vnthankfulneſſe and cruell tyranny.</p>

               <head>How the city of Ieruſalem after this deſtruction by <hi>Titus Veſpaſ.</hi> was vtterly beaten downe and defaced by <hi>Aelius Adr. Caeſar,</hi> which he re-edifying, called it after his own name Aelia.</head>
               <p>THe city of Ieruſalem being thus laid leuel with the ground, for the ſpace of ſixty yeares lay deſolate, a receptacle for theeues and murtherers, a fit place for Wolues and wilde beaſts, which reſorted thither to feed vpon the dead bodies. And now time conſuming their fleſh, left their bones and skuls to lye vpon the earth as in a Charnell houſe. Thus it continued vntill one
<hi>Benchochab</hi> (which ſignifies the Son of the Stars) born in the towne of Bethcoron not farre from Emaus, profeſſed himſelfe to be the Meſſiah or Chriſt. The Iewes ſuppoſing this to be true, becauſe of that ſaying of <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. <hi>There ſhall a Starre riſe vp out of Iacob)</hi> aſſembled themſelues to the number of many thouſands and followed him, with great tyranny and crueltie ſpoyling the Holy Land, and through all the countrey of Iudaea committing many outrages and maſſacres. Thus they continued for the ſpace of eighteene yeares, at the end of which time <hi>Adrianus Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> the Emperor hearing of thoſe inſolencies, leuied an Army and ſent them into Iudea, vnder the gouernment of
<hi>Iulius Seuerus,</hi> who in a pitcht field neere to Bethcoron and not far from Emaus conquered this <hi>Benchochab</hi> or <hi>Pſeudo-Meſsiah,</hi> and with him ſlew fiue hundred thouſand Iewes that were deceiued by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion. Now when they went to ſeeke for the body of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer amongſt the Dead (as ſaith <hi>Talmudiſta)</hi> hee was found lying with an horrible Serpent about his necke; intimating how
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7153:29"/> God reiected him that would ſeem to imitate his Son; for euen as the Serpent deceiued our firſt Parents, ſo this <hi>Benchochab</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Iews, and for this cauſe they called him <hi>Bencozba,</hi> that is, <hi>The Son of Lying.</hi> The number of the Iewes which in the time of this war were ſlaine amounted to 500000 men, beſides many others that periſhed by peſtilence and famin. This warre hapned 64 yeares after the deſtruction of Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>After this ſecond deſolation of the Iewes, at the command of the Emperor (that there might be a final extirpation of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent city of Ieruſalem, and that the words of our Sauior might be fulfilled, <hi>Lo, there ſhall not be a ſtone left vpon a ſtone, Mat.</hi> 24) the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines and foundations thereof were digged vp, the ſtones broken in pieces, the ground left deſolate, and the mountains are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come barren and ouergrown with brambles: And that the name thereof might vtterly be forgotten, and as it were rooted out of the earth, hee ſet vp a new towne not far from the hill Gihon and Golgotha where Chriſt was crucified; which after he had ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with many goodly buildings, he called it by his owne name, Aelia. In the place of the Temple he ſet vp a Church in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> Iuſt in the place where the holy Altar ſtood, he erected his own image vpon a marble pillar, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued vntill Saint
<hi>Hieroms</hi> time. At Bethlehem he erected the Image of <hi>Adonis,</hi> and to that he conſecrated at Church. Vpon the gates of the City he cut Hogs in marble, in contempt of the Iewes. Then did hee abiure them, That they ſhould not come within the walls of the City, nor ſet foot vpon the ground neere Ieruſalem. This being done, (as <hi>Dion</hi> ſaith) he dedicated it to the honour of <hi>Iupiter Capitolinus;</hi> and only made it free for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and ſuch like to be in it. This town at this day we call Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, although it be ſcituated in another place, and called by another name.</p>
               <p>Future Ages calling the actions of precedent times into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, puld a great contempt vpon this Towne, and ſo much the rather, becauſe Infidelitie and other heatheniſh prophaneſſe was cheriſht within this city. So that that which a little before was ſet vp in honour of the Emperour <hi>Aelianus,</hi> is now growne into contempt. Wherfore <hi>Helena</hi> the mother of
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7153:29"/> hauing command of that Empire, to giue ſome ſatisfaction to the vniuerſalitie, cauſed thoſe prophane Temples and Idols to be aboliſhed, and in their places erected others. Vpon mount Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha the church called <hi>Golgothanus;</hi> vpon the mount of Olives one in the place of the aſcention of Chriſt: and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> her ſon richly adorned the Sepulchre, and ouer it built a ſtately Temple all of poliſht marble, richly gilt with gold, ſo that to this day it remaines as the chiefe ornament of the town. In this mans time the Iewes with great boldneſſe indeauoured to rebuild the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple iuſt in the place where it ſtood before: but at the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Emperour they were repelled, and in recompence of their preſumption had their eares cut off and their noſes ſlit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had eares and would not heare, neither obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of our Sauior.</p>
               <p>But as the Emperor was religious, and endeauored to ſupport Chriſtianitie, ſo his ſucceſſor <hi>Iulianus</hi> was as full of impietie and prophaneneſſe; who that he might fruſtrat the prophecie of our Sauior, That Ieruſalem ſhould neuer be built again, in contempt cauſed the Iewes to aſſemble together, and with all expedition reſtore it to its former glory, giuing the vttermoſt of his helpe to their endeauours. But as they were ſeriouſly labouring in this work, of a ſudden there came a great earthquake, and looke what they had built was by that quite ouerturned; then fire came out of the earth and from heauen, which deſtroied both the matter and the Workemen. And that the Iewes nor any Philoſophers might impute it to a natural cauſe, there was ſeen in the heauens a bloudy croſſe, and vpon their cloathes croſſes ſhining like ſtars, which the Iewes could by no means wipe off. Yet this little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed: a ſecond time they attempted, &amp; as before, a ſecond earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake hapned, with a ſtorme of winde, which came with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme violence, that all the ſtuffe which they had heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for this purpoſe was vtterly blown away and deſtroyed. So that of force they were conſtrained to leaue off, &amp; acknowledge, That Chriſt, whom their Forefathers had crucified, was the true Meſſiah. <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> report, That neuertheleſſe the Iewes euen to this day, although it coſt them much money, come yearely to the place where Ieruſalem ſtood, and vpon the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7153:30"/> day of the deſtruction thereof weep ouer it. Such was their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vnto this City.</p>
               <p>But theſe euils were purged with a ſudden inuaſion (for no crying iniuries nor prophane inſolencies againſt God paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, but that then or ſoone after a iuſt reuenge falls vpon them) for <hi>Coſroës</hi> Emperor of the Perſians, whoſe impudencie and impietie was ſo great that hee would be worſhipped as a god, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare of our Lord
615, beſieged this town, tooke it, and put to death 90000. Chriſtians, carried the Patriarch thereof, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many others away captiue. But <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to puniſh him for his pride and crueltie ſet vpon Perſia, and with fire and ſword deſtroied the country not far from Nineueh, conquered his chiefe captain <hi>Razetis</hi> in a ſet battell, won the city of Nineueh, and went away with an honorable victorie. <hi>Seroës</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, the only begotten ſonne of <hi>Coſroës,</hi> but a little before inuading the kingdom, kild his father in priſon, reſtored the Patriarch and the reſt of the Captiues which his father had taken, to <hi>Heraclius:</hi> and about the ſeuenth yeare after hee had warred vpon Perſia, hee returned to Aelia with great pompe.</p>
               <p>Not long after, in the yeare 637, <hi>Haumar</hi> the chiefe Prince of the Saracens, which was the third from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> with a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my afflicted Syria and Iudaea, conquered theſe Countries, and in his victories vſed great tyrannie and crueltie. Within two yeares after, he won Aelia, which had maintained a long and ſharp ſiege; neither would <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Patriarch giue it vp, til he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thereto by extreme famin, and ſoon after died with griefe.</p>
               <p>Thus this towne continued for the ſpace of 450 yeares in the hands of the Saracens. Then in the yere 1012, <hi>Caliphas</hi> Sultan of Egypt won it, beat downe the walls, deſtroied the Temple which the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had built, and made havock of al things. Preſently vpon this, the Turkes that came out of Scythia by the Caſpian mountains, won the city, &amp; draue thence the Saracens. Thus we may ſee that the Saracens and Turks, though they were both of one religion, yet for the country of the Iewes fought one againſt another, and compelled the Chriſtians to pay them Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute for the fourth part of the city, wherein the Sepulchre of our Lord ſtood, being againe reſtored by the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deſtruction of <hi>Caliphas.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:7153:30"/>The Chriſtians being weary of this tribute, and of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Infidels, became ſutors to Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the ſecond of that name, for their deliuery; who in the yeare 1094 aſſembled a Councel at Clearemont in France, and by the inſtigation of one
<hi>Peter</hi> the hermit, ſtirred vp the hearts of diuers Chriſtian princes and great Lords to make a croyſado; ſo that 10000 braue &amp; well mounted ſouldiers went into the Holy land, and for a token of their war bore red croſſes vpon their armes.</p>
               <p>In the ſame yeare there was a great blaſing ſtarre ſeene in the Weſt, and after that followed a great plague for the ſpace of two yeares through the world: this neuertheleſſe hindred them not in their deſignes, but that they went their intended journy, won the City of Aelia from the Saracens, deliuered the Chriſtians from their bondage and tax, and choſe
<hi>Godfrey</hi> of Lorrain Earle of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion King thereof, whom they anointed in the Temple of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sepulchre; but hee refuſed to be crowned with a Crowne of gold, ſaying, That it ill beſeemed him to be called King of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, (the true King whereof was Chriſt) or to ſit crowned with gold, in the place where he was crowned with thorns that was the Son of the euer-liuing God: and then choſe <hi>Arnolphus</hi> of Rhodes Patriarch.</p>
               <p>In the moneth of October the ſame yeare, a blaſing Starre of maruellous bigneſſe appeared towards the South: it ſeemed to be like a wauing ſword, foreſhewing no doubt the deſtruction of all thoſe that went about to re-eſtabliſh this earthly Ieruſalem. Immediatly after the Feaſt of the Natiuitie of Chriſt, all the Chriſtians of the Eaſt countries vpon Candlemas day came out of Syria, but eſpecially out of Antiochia, to Ieruſalem, &amp; in the Temple of the holy Sepulchre conſecrated their Biſhops and Choraſters, and with one conſent ſung <hi>Illuminare Ieruſalem.</hi> They tooke alſo all the Cities, Caſtles, and Villages, and ouer them ſet Biſhops; created foure Principalities, one at Ieruſalem, another at Antiochia, a third at Ediſſa, a fourth at Tripoly. Alſo certain Earledomes and Baronies, as at Brito, Zidon, Caeſarea, Galilee, Ioppa, and Aſcalon. All theſe were appointed to pay tribute to the King of Ieruſalem. All this was done in the yere of our Lord, 1099.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:7153:31"/>No ſooner were theſe newes publiſhed to the world, but there was an vniuerſall croyſado through all Chriſtendom, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and winning of the reſt of the holy land, but before they could get thither, they were either ſlaine by the Grecians and other nations, or els died through famin &amp; thirſt: ſo that in them was fulfilled the prophecie of <hi>Zacharias, cap.</hi> 12.3. where it is ſaid, <hi>It ſhall happen that I will make Ieruſalem an heauy ſtone for all people all they that lift it vp ſhal be torn, though all the people of the earth be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together againſt it.</hi> And verſe 9, <hi>And in that day I will ſeeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the nations that come againſt Ieruſalem.</hi>

                  <hi>Baldwin</hi> the ſecond ſucceeded his vncle, and was the third king of Ieruſalem. He began his reign <hi>Anno</hi> 1118.

                  <hi>Fulco</hi> in right of his wife ſucceeded his father in law, &amp; was the fourth King of Ieruſalem. This <hi>Fulco</hi> was brother to the King of England, he reigned 13 years, fought many worthy battels againſt the Turkes, put 3000 of their men to the ſword, tooke many of them priſoners and caried them to Ieruſalem. After that, as hee was hunting the Hare by Acon, riding ſpeedily, hee fell from his horſe and was ſorely bruſed, whereof he died, and left two ſonnes called <hi>Baldwin</hi> and <hi>Almerick.</hi>

                  <hi>Baldwin</hi> the third was the fifth King of Ieruſalem, and ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his father. He won the city of Aſcalon, he rebuilt the towne of Boza, (which had beene deſtroyed) placed there certaine Knights Templers, he loſt the City of Ediſſa to the Saracens,

               <p>After him ſucceeded his brother <hi>Almerick,</hi> as was the ſixt king of Ieruſalem. In the time of this king the Sultan of Egypt gaue a great ouerthrow to the Knights Templers; which he ſeeking to reuenge, inuaded Egypt with a great army, beſieged the great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Alcaire, but to ſmall purpoſe; wherefore returning back to Ieruſalem, he ſhortly after died, when he had reigned 12 years: he left behinde him three children, a ſonne called <hi>Baldwin,</hi> and two daughters, <hi>Sibilla</hi> and <hi>Iſabella.</hi>

                  <hi>Baldwin</hi> the fourth ſucceeded his father, and was the ſeuenth king of Ieruſalem; who abuſing his gouernment was ſtruck with leproſie, with the contagion of which diſeaſe he died miſerably, in the 25 yere of his age, hauing reigned 13 years. <hi>Baldwin</hi> the fift of that name, the onely begotten ſon of his ſiſter <hi>Sibil,</hi> by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent was choſen his ſucceſſor, a youth of 9 yeares old, his fathers name was <hi>William Mountferrat,</hi> earle of March, who dying, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther married one <hi>Guy</hi> Earle of Luſignan, to whom <hi>Baldwin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the protection of the kingdome and of his yong kinſman till he came to mans eſtate. But this yong man within 7 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of his vncle, died ſitting at his table, not without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition of poiſon. <hi>Guy</hi> his protector, by the perſuaſion of his wife, and at the inſtigation of the Ieroſolimits, took vpon him the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment: but <hi>Raimond</hi> Earle of Tripoli was his great aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for that <hi>Baldwin</hi> 4. for his exceeding pride, at the inſtigation of that <hi>Guy</hi> had diſplaced him of all his Offices and titles in the commonwealth.

<hi>Raimond</hi> made war againſt him. During theſe troubles, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine</hi> Sultan of Egypt taking aduantage of this opportunitie, made war vpon them both, and with great facility conquered the kingdome and deſtroied Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>In this yeare 1187, there happened ſo great an Eclipſe of the Sunne, that at noone day the Starres were plainely to bee ſeene. Soone after this, <hi>Raimond</hi> and <hi>Guy</hi> were both taken priſoners, and thirty thouſand Chriſtians cruelly put to the ſword. After this, the Saracens ſacked the Towne, threw the Bells out of the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7153:32"/> made ſtables of the Churches; only the Temple on Mount Golgotha ſtood vntoucht: for the Turkes and Saracens honour Chriſt as a great Prophet.</p>
               <p>And thus the new kingdome of the Chriſtians in Ieruſalem ended, which was vpon the ſecond day of October, in the yeare 1187, after it had continued in their poſſeſſion 88 yeares. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the continuance of this kingdome there were many horrible viſions and ſtrange Signes and Wonders ſeene both in Heauen, on earth, and in the ayre; foreſhewing (no doubt) that God was not well pleaſed with their actions which ſought to reſtore that kingdom of Ieruſalem. For, <hi>My kingdome</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is not of this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although after that, there were many Kings that by all poſſible means endeauored to recouer and reſtore the ſame, and for that purpoſe haue leauied many great Armies, and vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken many tedious journies; yet all their counſels and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions came to nothing, for that God ſo often as they vndertooke any ſuch expedition, either ſtayed their Armies, oppreſſed them with war, or elſe plagued them with famine, in ſuch an extreame meaſure, that with very hunger they haue bin conſtrained to eat their Horſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſus</hi> may be an example of theſe calamities; who with a great army making an expedition to Ieruſalem, as he was trauelling through <hi>Aſia minor,</hi> his horſe ſtarted and flung him into the riuer, where he died miſerably ere he could be ſaued. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Princes, beſides in the like enterpriſe came to the like ends; for they were either deſtroied by the Barbarians, with the loſſe of thouſands of their men cruelly ſlain, or vtterly deſtroied with vnnatural diſeaſes or vntimely deaths.</p>
               <p>Now when the Emperour <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſecond of that name had beſeeged and brought to great miſerie the Sultan of Egypt, and the Knights Templers had done the like to <hi>Damieta; Corderio</hi> the Sultans ſon beat downe the walls of Ieruſalem, and had it not bin for the great lamentations and erneſt entreaties of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, he would haue deſtroied the city; but for their ſakes he left ſtanding <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, and the Temple of the holy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre; for at this time Chriſtians inhabit in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:7153:32"/>Within a while after, about the yeare 1228, <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of that name, Emperor of Rome, went to the holy land with a great army, and came to Ptolomais, otherwiſe called Acon, where ſtaying a while, he made a league with the Sultan of Egipt for ten years, regained Ieruſalem without drawing ſword, &amp; was there crowned in the yeare 1229, keeping at that time in Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem a royal Eaſter. This man fortified the Chriſtians with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, rebuilt Nazareth and Ioppa, and ſo returned into Italy.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1246, <hi>Caſſanus</hi> King of the Tartars being perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Sultan, with a great army inuaded Iudaea, won Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, cauſed the Chriſtians to be cruelly ſlaine, beat downe the holy Sepulchre euen to ſmall pieces, and left but little ſtanding. It was after this deſtroyed by <hi>Tamerlaine</hi> King of the Tartars, and by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond of that name, Emperour of the Turkes.

               <p>In the yeare of our Lord 1516, <hi>Selymus</hi> Emperor of the Turks, about the twenty fourth day of Auguſt, neere to Damaſcus ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Campſon Gaurus</hi> Sultan of Egypt in a cruell Warre, and put to death many thouſands of his men; and the Sultan himſelfe ſeeking to ſaue his life by flight was miſerably ſlaine. This <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymus</hi> conquered the Holy Land, Syria, Damaſcus, and all the Countries thereabouts; and as he went through Iudaea, leauing his Army at Gaza, with a few of his Souldiers he went to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, that he might ſee with his eyes that place which was made ſo famous by the antient Writers, and was ſo often mentioned in the Old and New Teſtament. But when he came he found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ruinate and waſte place, barren and rude to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, inhabited by a few poore Chriſtians, and they alſo held in great contempt and bondage, paying a great tribute to the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan of Egypt, for their liberty and the holy Sepulchre, as <hi>P. Iouius</hi> writeth. But after that <hi>Selymus</hi> in that place had done his Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and Sacrifices to his god <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſeeing the Prieſts and Chriſtians preſt with extreme pouertie, out of his ſingular mercy and compaſſion gaue them a large and ſumptuous gift, when hee had ſtayed but one day and one night in the Towne. The next
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7153:33"/> morning before day he went with all expedition to his Army at Gaza, &amp; from thence into Egypt, where he beſieged the great and famous city Alcaire, and in the yeare 1517 took it, conquered all the country, vtterly extirpated the Sultan, and went away with an honorable victory and rich booty. From this yeare euen till now, the towne of Aelia or Ieruſalem is vnder the juriſdiction of the Turks. Thus may we ſee how often, and with what miſerable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities this city hath bin afflicted, euen ſince the firſt deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by <hi>Veſpaſian;</hi> which makes euident the great iudgment of God not only vpon the Iews, but alſo vpon the earth where they inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, for their infidelitie and vnmercifull cruelty.</p>

<hi>Conſtantine,</hi> but deſtroyed by <hi>Caliphas</hi> Sultan of Egypt: then by the Emperours of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople rebuilt, which continueth to this day. It is round in the proportion, adorned with 79 pillars 30 foot long; the wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by the Diameter (beſides the pillars) is 73 feet, leaded aboue, and vpon the top of the roofe ſtandeth a Lanthorn, by which the light commeth in: this Lanthorne is very curiouſly glaſed. In the middle ſtandeth the holy Sepulchre. To this ioyneth the Church in mount Golgotha, and ſerueth in ſtead of a Quire. It ſtandeth ſomething lower, but all vnder one roofe. The place where the holy Sepulchre ſtandeth is four ſquare, eight foot long and eight broad, hewne out of a rocke, and couered with marble; there is a little doore in the Eaſt part of it, very low, by which men go into it, and within that the Sepulchre it ſelf ſtandeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the North ſide, made of gray marble, three handfuls high, and eight foot long. There are no windowes for light to come to it, but ouer there hangeth continually nine lamps burning, wherby it receiueth light. The vault of this Sepulchre is diuided with a wall; the outward is both of the ſame proportion and length as the inward, but that which is without ſeemeth to be an entrie to the inner caue where Chriſt was buried: and there (as ſome ſay) euen to this day is found a piece of the ſtone which the Angell rolled from the graue before the reſurrection; the other part of the ſtone (howſoeuer it came there) lyes vpon mount Sion. But ſome thinke that the Armenians carried it thither, becauſe vpon it they haue built an Altar. In this inner caue there hangs nine lamps to giue light vnto them that enter in by the Eaſt; ſo that in the inner and outer Vault there ſtandeth eighteene Lamps. The Mount whereon Chriſt was crucified ſeemeth to ſtand vpon a rocke of ſtone, whitiſh and ſomthing bluſhing. It is diſtant from the holy Sepulcre 130 foot. The place where the Croſſe ſtood was an hard rocke, eighteene ſteps in the aſcent, and anſwereth to nine and twenty feet. The hole where the Croſſe ſtood is about
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7153:34"/> the roundneſſe of a mans head in latitude; and if a man might beleeue the Monkes thereabouts, they ſay alſo that in that place is to be ſeene the colour of our Sauiours bloud euen to this day.

               <p>THis Temple lieth towards the Eaſt, and was built by the Chriſtians iuſt in the ſame place where the former Temple ſtood at the time when this City was rebuilt and inlarged. The body thereof is very high and ſpatious, and built of poliſht mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, adorned with moſt exquiſit and curious workemanſhip, very artificiall and glorious both within and without, inſomuch that the poliſhed ſtones caſt a ſingular beautifull and reſplendant lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre. Aboue it is couered with lead, and was built vp at the coſt and labor of the Grecians; in the roofe whereof the Turks place an halfe moone, as they vſually doe in all ſuch churches wherein they come and haue authority. The Turkes and Saracens haue this Temple in great reuerence and deuotion, they adorne it (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their cuſtome) with diuers artificial pictures and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems. They will ſuffer no Chriſtians to enter into it, nor any Iewes vpon paine of death. And if it happens that at any time they go into it, they firſt waſh themſelues with water very clean, then put off their hoſe and ſhoos, and ſo go bare foot. This Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they call the holy Rocke, and in the body thereof there han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth 700 lamps which burne night and day. In the midſt hereof there ſtandeth a certaine little rocke euery where indented with yron, neere to which not any of the Saracens or Infidels dare to approach or touch, although there come many very farre to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7153:34"/> it: for they beleeue that there were many memorable &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy things done in that rock: they think that <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> the firſt Prieſt of the great God offered bread and wine vpon it, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 14. and that here the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaw the Ladder which reached from heauen to earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. which indeed hapned not in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, but in Bethel, as the Scriptures witneſſe. Further they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that vpon this ſtone <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaw the Angel of the Lord ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with a ſhaken ſword when he ſtrook the city with the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. and that the Prieſts of the old Teſtament offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon this ſtone their ſacrifices to the Lord, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured with fire from heauen. All which things do vtterly differ from holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Iewes alſo are of opinion, That the prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> about the time of the captiuity of Babylon, in this ſtone hid the Ark of the Couenant, vntill ſuch time as the Lord brought the people backe again from the captiuitie. Which is contrarie alſo to the books of the holy Scripture; for, 2 <hi>Mach.</hi> 2. it is ſaid, it was hid in the mount Nebo, where
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood when he ſaw the whole land of Canaan. Alſo the Turkes ſay that Chriſt ſate vpon this ſtone when <hi>Simeon</hi> tooke him in his armes and bleſſed him. Here alſo he ſate in the midſt of the Doctors when he was but twelue yeares of age,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 2. which alſo differeth from the Scripture; for this was not the body of the Temple, but in the middle court or <hi>Solomons</hi> porch, which ſometimes was taken for the Temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ioyned to it. And diuers circumſtances of the Scripture do ſeeme to make this euident, becauſe heere Chriſt taught, and here the people vſually met together, as appeareth, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 10. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.</p>
               <p>About the Temple of Ieruſalem there is a fair Plain much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling our Church yards, all paued with marble ſtone. To this there is adioyning a faire Church couered with lead, &amp; was ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called <hi>Solomons</hi> porch; but after the Chriſtians had woon Ieruſalem they gaue it the name of S. <hi>Maries.</hi> The Turke keepes burning in this daily 800 lamps, and it is much greater than that of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple. The Sultan of Egypt alſo about an hundred yeares before, built a little Church or Moſcho cloſe by <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, wherein are continually burning 88 Lampes. There
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7153:35"/> is a vault vnder the Temple of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of ſuch an extraordinary greatneſſe that 600 horſe may eaſily be placed in it.

From whence may euidently appeare, That thoſe places which are now ſhewen to Pilgrims by the Monkes of Ieruſalem, are

               <p>IN and about the church which is built ouer the holy ſepulcre vpon mount Calvarie, there are at this day many of diuers nations and countries which inhabit, of diuers opinions and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. And although they differ in material points of their faith, yet would they be al Chriſtians: of which number there are ſome Latines, Greekes, Abiſſines, Armenians, Gregorians, Neſtorians, Surians, and Iacobins.</p>
               <p>The Latines for the moſt part are ſuch as wee call Franciſcan Monks, Obſeruants, or Friers.<note place="margin">Latines.</note> Theſe haue the keeping of the holy Sepulchre, and looke to it very diligently; where ſomtimes they make a certain number of Knights of the noble Order of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Templers, with many ceremonies and great ſolemnities. Theſe Knights are girt with a ſword all gilt, hanging in a red velvet gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; a chain of gold is put vpon them worth about 100 Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian duckets, at the end whereof there hangs a Ieruſalem Croſſe of gold. This kind of croſſe alſo they are permitted to weare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their armes and clothes; then haue they a paire of gilt ſpurres with velvet tyings. But before they are admitted into this order, they muſt ſweare vpon the holy Sepulchre to maintain &amp; defend the doctrine of the Pope.</p>
               <p>The Grecians that are there be alſo Monkes,<note place="margin">Grecians.</note> and doe inhabit within the Temple of the holy Sepulchre; but they haue the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the place where our Sauior Chriſt was crucified, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Romaniſts. For they beleeue firſt, That the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and not the Sonne. Secondly,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7153:36"/> they giue the Sacraments in both kinds; thirdly, they hold not the Pope to be head of the Church; fourthly, they deny Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and prayer for the dead; fiftly, they ſing Maſſe in their own language that euery man may vnderſtand it, but they obſerue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Sacraments as the Romaniſts do.

               <p>The reſt of the Grecians that are through the Eaſt parts leaue mariage free, as well for the Clergy as Laity, and condemne the Latine Prieſts becauſe they marry not. They allow no grauen images in their Churches, but in ſome places of their Churches they haue faire painted pictures hanging. They approue not the Pope, but haue a Patriarch for their high Biſhop, which Patriark is greatly reuerenced, and much honored in Conſtantinople.</p>

               <p>Hereby you may note, how the temple of the holy Sepulchre in Ieruſalem is filled with many Sects, who altogether giue and pay tribute to the Emperour of the Turkes; whereby you may ſee that Chriſt will be no more ſought in the holy Sepulchre, but rather in the holy Euangeliſts, where he ſuffereth himſelfe to be found by all thoſe that ſeeke him with a pure heart.</p>

               <p>THe Saracens are a people of Arabia the ſtony; of the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he begat of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi> From whence they are rightly called
<hi>Agarins,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they had rather bee called Saracens. Others call them
<hi>Saracens, à Saraca,</hi> which is a part of Arabia the ſtony. It ſeemeth therefore that theſe people tooke their name from a principality; for <hi>Sarar</hi> in Hebrew is the ſame that <hi>Principatum geſsit</hi> is in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, or if you will, <hi>Principatum obtinuit,</hi> which ſignifies (to obtaine Principalitie.) And therefore the Saracens, or Sarazens, may be ſaid Princes or Captaines, whoſe Principalitie extends it ſelfe far and neere: but <hi>Agarins</hi> ſignifies Peregrinators; for <hi>Gor</hi> or <hi>Gar</hi> is as much to ſay as a Pilgrim.</p>
               <p>Theſe people combined themſelues with <hi>Mahomet</hi> that falſe Prophet, borne of obſcure parentage: his fathers name was <hi>Abdiminech,</hi> of his wife that was of the family of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> or of the Saracens, borne in Arabia the ſtony, (and as it is expreſt in their Alcaron) vpon the xxj. day of September, according to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, about the yeare of Chriſt 570. he tooke his name from a tumultuous confuſion: for <hi>hamah</hi> ſignifies
<hi>tumultuatus eſt,</hi> he hath beene tumultuous; And <hi>Hamam, tumultuando diſturbauit,</hi> He diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by contention. From hence <hi>Maimo</hi> ſignifies
<hi>tumultuor,</hi> A contender, and <hi>Maiomai, concitor,</hi> a rebell. From whence may be gathered, That <hi>Mahomet</hi> is an ominous &amp; ſeditious name. Whiles he was in his infancie hee liued with his father; after, being of a prompt wit, he ſerued one <hi>Abdomoneplis</hi> a Merchant, in whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice conuerſing with Chriſtians and Iewes, he got a ſmattering knowledge of the old and new Teſtament, and many acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; amongſt which was one
<hi>Sergius</hi> an Arian Monke, a man very well affected of this <hi>Abdomoneplis. Abdomoneplis</hi> died, and by the perſuaſion of this Monke, <hi>Mahomet</hi> married
<hi>Cadican</hi> his wife, although ſhe was fiftie yeares of age, and by her had great riches: ſhee ſoone after alſo died, and left <hi>Mahomet</hi> all that ſhee had. He on a ſudden, being lift vp to this height of ſubſtance, grew very ambitious (for he was naturally proud, wrathfull, a theefe, a whoremaſter, a moſt impudent adulterer, and wherſoeuer he came
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7153:38"/> made hauocke of all things. (This man by the helpe of the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and others, affected the kingdome of Arabia, which within ſhort time after he obtained, entring Mecha the chiefe city ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, vpon Thurſday the fifteenth of Iuly, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 622. and by the helpe of two Iewes and this <hi>Sergius,</hi> wrote that blaſphemous Law of the Alcoron, falſly profeſſing himſelfe to be a Prophet, and began cruelly to oppoſe himſelfe againſt all neighbouring nations and cities.</p>
               <p>The Alcaron taketh the name from <hi>Splendor</hi> or <hi>Brightneſſe;</hi> for <hi>Al</hi> in the Arabicke, is as much as <hi>Karan</hi> in the Hebrew, and that ſignifies <hi>to ſhine or caſt forth a brightneſſe.</hi> This Alcaron containes a blaſphemous and deteſtable law, written in the Arabian tongue without any order or colour of knowledge, teaching manifeſt lyes, and execrable blaſphemies againſt God; and for the moſt part, the pleaſures and delights of this world: for he doth deny that there is one eternall eſſence of the Deitie, and the holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; our Sauiour Chriſt they one while call the Sonne of God, and another while, the Soule or Spirit of God. They deny his Deitie, but ſay, that he was a holy man, borne without a father, of the chaſt and incorruptible Virgin <hi>Marie.</hi> And although he was before all beginning, yet they beleeue that he was not begotten, but created before all other eſſentiall creatures, by the eternall God. Alſo they ſay hee was not crucified, but ſome other in his place; and therefore the ſaluation of man not to conſiſt in the merits of Chriſt, but in our owne proper workes. And that the Iewes might embrace the Alcaron, they retaine Circumciſion, which is commonly done when the children are thirteene yeares of age; about which time, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was circumciſed. They forbeare the meates forbidden in the Law; they haue many wiues at one time; they tollerate a bil of Diuorce, and affirme that after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection men may haue many wiues, and with them banquet, ſurfet, and vſe pleaſant recreations, with diuers ſuch errours and vaine trifles, which for breuities ſake I omit.</p>
               <p>That hee might the better perſwade men to embrace and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue theſe his lies, and blaſphemous doctrines, he very cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeemed to confirme them with many falſe and fained miracles:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7153:39"/> and amongſt the reſt this was one: Hauing taught a white Doue to fetch corne in his eare, whiles he was preaching to the people, it chanced ſhe came and ſat vpon his ſhoulder, and putting her bill into his eare according to her accuſtomed manner, he perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the people that it was the ſpirit of God, which deliuered him the words of the Law. A Bull alſo, taught after the ſame manner, at his voice came before him, and kneeling downe did him reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, with the Alcaron tied vpon his hornes; which he affirmed was come from heauen and brought that new Law. Then did hee make diuers hornes of gold and ſiluer, and filling them full of milke hid them in the earth: after which, in a great aſſembly he cauſed the ſame places to be opened, and told the people that theſe ſignified plenty and abundance, to all ſuch as kept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued that Law: But the violaters thereof ſhould be puniſhed with death. Together with many other ſuch like idle and fooliſh miracles, (which would be too tedious to recite) that he might make the people beleeue that it came from God. And being afflicted with the falling ſickeneſſe, gaue it out, that then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell <hi>Gabriel</hi> told him the Law, making this likewife a meanes to further his deſignes: but after, <hi>viz.</hi> vpon the eighth of Iune, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 632. and in the ſixtie one yeare of his age, he died miſerably of this diſeaſe, after he had raigned in Mecha ten yeres; and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bubizer</hi> or
<hi>Abubachar</hi> his father in law ſucceeded him in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, who built in his honour a Church, and in that put his ſepulchre, both ſtately and ſumptuous.</p>
               <p>The Turkes alſo embrace this doctrine, and joyned their forces with the Saracens: They extended their Empire vnder <hi>Mahomet</hi> the third, into Aſia, Europe, and Affrica.

So that Nilus is diuided into nine gates, by which nine gates it falls into the Mediterranean Sea. There are many that thinke, that Paradiſe was only in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and that then it had onely but foure ſtreams, and that at the Floud it was confuſed into nine, and they would ſeeme to proue their opinion out of the 31 chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where hee calleth Egypt a garden of pleaſure. But this differeth from the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for it is not ſcituate in the Eaſt, but rather the South from Ieruſalem, and farre diſtant from the two Eaſterne Riuers, Euphrates and Hiddikel, by which the holy Scriptures do prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally denote Paradiſe. Wherefore it may be concluded, that Aegypt was onely a part of Paradiſe, not Paradiſe it ſelfe: And that this Riuer was one of the Riuers, not all, the ſtreames of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7153:42"/> which Riuer at ſome times of the yeare, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Summer Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, when the Sunne is neere the Dogge-ſtarre, begins to ſwell and ouerflow the bankes, by reaſon of the melting of the ſnow which lies vpon the mountaines of the Moone, and ſo drowne all the places neere vnto it, through the land of Aegypt, leauing behind it certaine ſlime and mudde, by which it comes to paſſe, that the Countrey is very fruitfull, and ſerues them in ſteed of raine, at which time of the yeare (for this happens once euery yeare) the people and inhabitants of the Countrey retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to their Towns, Cities, and Caſtles, ſcituated vpon Rocks, Mountains, and high grounds, from whence it hapneth, that they ſuſtaine very little diſcommoditie or loſſe, by any ſuch inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They alſo keepe little boates, whereby they paſſe from one place to another, becauſe all their paſſages and foot paths are then drowned with waters. There are many pretty obſeruations which the people of Aegypt were wont to take notice of in the riſing of this water, for they had certain ſtaues wherby they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the deapth of it, if it roſe but to twelue cubits (which is ſix yards in height, they then ſtood in feare of great famine, ſo alſo if it was but thirteene, for then the water was not deepe enough to make the ground fertill: but if it roſe to fourteene or fifteene, then they were in great hope, and did not doubt of a fruitfull yeare: and if to ſixteene, they then greatly rejoyced at their proſperity, and kept banquets and feaſts, and were aſſured that the ſucceeding yeare would be very plentifull: but if it roſe aboue, they laid a ſide all ſignes of joy, and liued very ſparingly, and with great ſorrow; this great inundation of waters foreſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarcitie, and want, and famine, and peſtilence, and death. And thus Nilus yearely, euery yeare is to them in ſtead of raine, for Aegypt is without raine.</p>
               <p>In Autumne, at ſuch time as the Sunne going out of the laſt face of Libra, entreth into Scorpio, the waters of Nilus by little and little retire themſelues into their bankes, and the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes quite vncouered of water: about which time, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being exceeding hot, the earth is preſently made drie in all thoſe places, ſo that in the moneth of October, they may both till and ſow their Land.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7153:93"/> to die honourably in the face of the enemy, but wretchedly in a corner, and for thine owne offence. So ſoone as he had ended theſe words, he turned him about with a fierce countenance, and falling vpon his father, mother, wife, and children, put them all to the ſword; after, burnt his goods; and to make an end of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, ran himſelfe vpon his owne weapon.

               <p>From thence <hi>Dauid</hi> went often towards the South, and made incurſions vpon the Amalekites, waſting and deſtroying their land which lay in the Deſart of Sur, about 80 miles diſtant from Ziclag, and a hundred and twenty miles from Ieruſalem towards the South-weſt</p>

Wherefore when <hi>Dauid</hi> came to Ziclag and perceiued what had hapned, with all ſpeed purſued the enemy; and in the way as hee went he found an Aegyptian, who a little before, the Amalekits had left there, becauſe he was vnable to follow them. This Aegyptian guided <hi>Dauid</hi> to the tents of the Amalekits, who ſuſpecting no ſuch euill, were making merry with the booty that they had taken.

This battell was fought ſome 8 or 12 miles from Ziclag, as by the circumſtance of the hiſtory may appeare.</p>
               <p>From this ſlaughter he returned backe to Ziclag, which is 12 miles, and repaired it; to euery neighbouring citie ſending a part of the prey. Here hee had certaine intelligence of the ſucceſſe of the Iſraelites in their wars againſt the Philiſtins, and of the death of

               <p>From thence he went to the valley of Rephaim, ſome 3 miles from Ieruſalem in the way that leadeth to the citie of Bethlem, where he fought a memorable fight againſt the Philiſtines, and ouercame them; for which cauſe it was alſo called Baal-Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim, becauſe by the helpe and aſſiſtance of God he had conquered the army of the Philiſtines, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.</p>

               <p>The Philiſtines came the ſame yeare into the valley of Repha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im againe, and pitched their tents within three miles and a halfe of Ieruſalem: and the Lord gaue <hi>Dauid</hi> a ſigne, that when he heard a noyſe in the mulberry trees, hee ſhould ſet vpon the enemy; ſo

<hi>Nachon,</hi> where <hi>Vza</hi> raſhly and inconſiderately touching the Arke of God, contrary to the Diuine Law, was preſently ſlaine by the Lord in the way, and that place was called <hi>Paeri-Vza,</hi> that is, <hi>The breach of Vza.</hi> For he was not of the Tribe of
<hi>Aaron,</hi> to whom it was only lawfull to touch the Arke, &amp; therfore the Lord ſtrooke him that he died miſerably: wherefore <hi>Dauid</hi> being terrified by this example of Gods ſeueritie, would not that day bring the ark of the Lord into Ieruſalem, but carried it to the houſe of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Nobleman called <hi>Obed-Aedom</hi> a Gittite, who dwelt not far from Ieruſalem; but when it was told <hi>Dauid,</hi> that the Lord bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the houſe of

               <p>He returned thence to Ieruſalem with great triumph and joy, 24 miles.</p>
               <p>In the 13 yeare of his raigne, <hi>Anno mundi,</hi> 2903, and before Chriſt, 1065, he made an expedition vnto Zoba, which <hi>Ioſephus</hi> calleth Sophenam, and is in Armenia, neere to Maſia or Mount Taurus, 600 miles from Ieruſalem towards the North, of which you may reade before. <hi>Dauid</hi> in this place woon a memorable battell againſt <hi>Hadad-Ezer</hi> the King thereof, neere to the riuer Euphrates; he tooke 700 horſe and 20000 foot, burnt their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, tooke 100 caſtles, conquered all the Townes and Countrey round about, and went away with a great bootie, as well of Gold as ſiluer, braſſe, and other things; which braſſe for the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie thereof was like vnto gold, and (as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith) afterwards
<hi>Solomon</hi> made the molten ſea of it. When <hi>Gadarezer</hi> King of the Syrians (he that built that famous citie of Damaſcus) heard of the ouerthrow of <hi>Hadad-Ezer,</hi> hee ſent a great army to his aid; which King <hi>Dauid</hi> neere to the riuer Euphrates ſmote with the ſword, ſo that 20000 of them were ſlaine, and he carried away a glorious victorie, extending his gouernment from Ieruſalem 600 miles towards the North, that is, into Armenia, and beyond the riuer Euphrates, and made theſe two nations tributary vnto him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 1
<hi>Chr.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Dauid</hi> had woon theſe 2 memorable victories neere Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates, he went thence with all his army towards the South, and inuaded the land of Syria; in which journey <hi>Ioram</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Tohi</hi> King of Antiochia (which citie at this time was called He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>math) met
<hi>Dauid</hi> with gifts and preſents in the name of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, returning him many thankes becauſe he had deſtroied the common enemy <hi>Hadad-Ezer,</hi> and by ſtrong hand ſubdued and quelled the furie of that mighty tyrant, who was alſo a trouble
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7153:97"/> and vexation to the Kingdome of Antiochia. <hi>Dauid</hi> entertained this meſſage kindly, &amp; thankfully receiued his gifts, (which was of gold, ſiluer and fine braſſe) and ſo gaue <hi>Ioram</hi> an acceptable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch, and from thence with his army went to Damaſcus, the Metropolitan citie of Syria, where in the valley of ſalt he got a great victory, in which 18000 Syrians were ſlaine, and ſoon after the Citie of Damaſcus taken; in which <hi>Dauid</hi> placed a garriſon, and compelled them to pay tribute, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. This was diſtant from the kingdome of Soba 520 miles.</p>
               <p>From Damaſcus he went with his army into the land of the Ammonites, 100 miles in the way that leadeth out of Syria to Ieruſalem, all which he conquered, and all the cities and townes thereabouts, and compelled them to pay tribute, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>From thence he returned to Ieruſalem, which was 60 miles, and all the bootie that he had gotten in his journey he dedicated vnto the Lord, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>A while after, hee with his army made an incurſion into the land of Idumaea, and compelled the inhabitants to pay tribute. Moreouer, he deſtroied the citie of Midian the Metropolitane of that countrey, of which you may reade before: it was diſtant from Ieruſalem 160 miles towards the South. So that the extent of <hi>Dauids</hi> kingdome from the North to the South, was 800 miles, euen from the kingdome of Soba to the Red ſea: and from the Eaſt to the Weſt 120 miles; from Tyrus and Sydon reaching to Damaſcus. Thus by the ſingular bleſſing of God he obtained a ſpacious and powerfull Empire, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 11. 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 19. He made his expedition into Idumaea about the 14 yeare of his raigne.</p>
               <p>From Midian in Idumaea, hee returned with great glory and praiſe to Ieruſalem, which was 160 miles.</p>
               <p>In the 14 yere of his raigne, and in the yere of the world 2904, and before Chriſt 1064,
<hi>Nahas</hi> King of the Ammonites died, and <hi>Haron</hi> his ſonne ſucceeded him: this man contemptuouſly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the meſſengers of <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. and to juſtifie that injury he gathered an army out of Soba, Siria, and Meſopotamia, euen a mighty Hoſt, to oppoſe <hi>Dauid;</hi> who in the 15 yeare of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment met him with his Armie at Helam, ſome twenty miles
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7153:98"/> from Ieruſalem where he obtained a notable victorie, and deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 700 chariots, and 40000 horſe, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> after this, with great applauſe of the people was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained into Ieruſalem, which was 20 miles diſtant, where being puft vp with proſperity, he forgat his former pietie and ſanctitie, and by degrees fell into vnlawfull actions and vnjuſt deſires: whence it hapned that ſoone after he committed adulterie with <hi>Bathſeba:</hi> &amp; after that, to hide his fault, cauſed her husband to be ſlaine. This was kept ſecret, till the Lord by <hi>Nathan</hi> ſharply repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends him, laies before him what hee was and what his preſent eſtate is, from whence that came, and then concludes, that he is moſt vnthankfull, careleſſe, and negligent towards God and man, in committing thoſe inſolencies; neither left he there, but told him that God would ſeuerely puniſh him for his offence, which after hapned as you may reade, 1 <hi>Sa.</hi> 11.12.14.17. <hi>Dauid</hi> being nipt in his conſcience with this ſharpe reprehenſion, fell into great lamentation, the extremitie of whoſe paſſions may very well appeare in the poenitentiall Pſalmes which at this time and ſoone after hee wrot, and left to future ages.</p>
               <p>After this, about the end of Summer he gathered an army, and went into the land of the Ammonites, ſome 64 miles, where hee took the Metropolitan citie, (which at that time was called Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, becauſe of the multitude of citizens that were in it; but after being reſtored by
<hi>Ptolomeus Philadelphus</hi> King of Aegypt, hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it after his own, Philadelphia) &amp; there took the crowne from the head of the king of the Ammonites, which weighed a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of<note n="*" place="margin">How much this was you may read after in the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of weights.</note> gold, being (as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith) richly adorned with faire Sardonicke ſtones, of which you may reade in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>From thence he returned back to Ieruſalem, which is 64 miles, where hee married
<hi>Bathſeba,</hi> and by her had foure ſonnes, <hi>Simeon, Sobab, Nathan,</hi> and
<hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 3. Soone after this, <hi>Ammon</hi> defloured his ſiſter
<hi>Thamar:</hi> not long after that, his ſon <hi>Abſalon</hi> killed his brother
<hi>Ammon,</hi> beeing then about 18 yeares of age; which <hi>Dauid</hi> tooke ſo hainouſly, that he would not ſuffer him to come into his ſight for three yeares, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. Then
<hi>Ioab</hi> by the ſubtiltie of the woman of Tekoa, reconciled him to the king his father: yet neuertheleſſe, he came not to his court of two yeares
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7153:98"/> after. This <hi>Abſolon</hi> was a goodly man, affable, for which cauſe enen at that time the people began to affect him.</p>
               <p>Afterward in the yeare of the world 2950, and before Chriſt 1408, <hi>Abſolon</hi> being then about 25 yeares of age, moued ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt his father. A matter remarkeable, that although he had ſlaine his owne brother, being diſgraced and abſent from the Court almoſt fiue yeres, yet within ſhort time after, he ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnited the affection of the people to him, that he conſtrained <hi>Dauid</hi> (ſtanding in feare of his greatneſſe, all his former acts and worthy victories notwithſtanding) to forſake his owne citie, and for ſafety to fly to the mount of Oliues, beeing three quarters of a mile from the citie.</p>
               <p>There he ſtaied a while to ſee the condition of the tumult, but neceſſitie conſtrained him to take his way to Bahuzim. And as he was going, <hi>Zimri</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Geſa</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> curſed him, euery mans enemy then making himſelfe apparant when he is in aduerſitie, and his beſt friends commonly forſake him.</p>
               <p>From thence hee went to Iordan, 14 miles, where the Prieſts <hi>Ionathan</hi> and
<hi>Ahinaaz</hi> brought him certaine intelligence of that wicked and peruerſe councell of
<hi>Achitophel,</hi> a man in thoſe times famous for his wiſdome, but perfidious in his actions, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuch are that hope after honours, or ſeeke to benefit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by innouation and change.</p>
               <p>After he had intelligence hereof, hee went ouer Iordan with thoſe few men that he had, &amp; with all poſſible ſpeed went to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thabara, ſome 16 miles from Ieruſalem toward the North-Eaſt. At this place <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> led the children of Iſrael through Iordan on drie ground, <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 3.4. and here <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt taught, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed Chriſt.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; Luke</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>From thence hee went to Makanaim, which is twentie eight miles, where hee ſent forth his army by bands againſt <hi>Abſolon,</hi> who at this time had aſſembled a great hoſt neere the Wood Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, not far from that place where <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> woon a memorable bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell againſt the Canaanites: and that the place might bee made more famous, <hi>Dauids</hi> men, though few in number, gaue <hi>Abſalon</hi> and his hoſt as great. Thus <hi>Abſalon</hi> being left in danger, to ſaue himſelf fled: but in his flight the haire of his head being long, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7153:99"/> blowne with the wind, tooke hold of the branch of a tree, by which he hanged betweene heauen and earth, as vnworthy of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and <hi>Ioab,</hi> who but a little before was his friend, in that very place with three darts put him to death, a juſt end for ſo vnjuſt a man. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> notwithſtanding tooke the death of <hi>Abſolon</hi> maruellous heauily, till by <hi>Ioab</hi> he was recalled from that griefe; and then in the company of <hi>Barzillai,</hi> and of his ſonne <hi>Chimea,</hi> of <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and <hi>Zeba</hi> his ſeruant, <hi>Shimei</hi> alſo that before curſt him, (who to leaue a memorable token of a baſe Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophant) after this victory came firſt downe to craue pardon for his offence, with many others, went along with him from Maka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naim to Bethabara, which was 28 miles. To this place there came a great multitude of people to meet <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. This <hi>Barzillai</hi> was one of the eighteene that held the principalitie of the citie of the Giliadites, and had a ſonne called <hi>Chimea,</hi> whom <hi>Dauid</hi> tooke with him to Ieruſalem, that he might make euident his thankefulneſſe towards him for that courteſie which he had receiued of his father.</p>
               <p>From Bethabara <hi>Dauid</hi> paſſed Iordan, and went backe to Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, which was 4 miles, 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>From thence he went to Ieruſalem, which was 12 miles, in the ſame yeare that he was exiled by his ſonne, which was about the 13 yeare of his raigne. The next yere <hi>Saba</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Bicri,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king example of <hi>Abſolon,</hi> and obſeruing the mutabilitie of the peoples affections, moued a ſedition againſt <hi>Dauid,</hi> but <hi>Ioab</hi> his captain ouercame him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. After this, there followed three yeares of famine. About the end of the third yeare of famine, and in the 34 yeare of his raigne, <hi>Dauid</hi> went to Iabes Gilead, which was 52 miles, to fetch the bones of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> to bury them in the ſepulchre of his fathers, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>From Iabes in Gilead, <hi>Dauid</hi> brought the bones and relickes of King <hi>Saul</hi> and
<hi>Ionathan</hi> his ſonne, to Gibeah of <hi>Saul,</hi> which was 52 miles, and there he honourably buried them in the Sepulchre of his father <hi>Kiſh.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>From thence <hi>Dauid</hi> returned to Ieruſalem, which was 4 miles.</p>
               <p>In the 35 yere of his raigne he went forth to fight againſt the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7153:99"/> Philiſtines, neer to the Leuiticall towne of Nob, or Nobe, which is 12 miles from Ieruſalem, vpon the borders of the countries of the Philiſtines, in the tribe of Dan.</p>
               <p>From thence he returned backe againe to Ieruſalem, which is 12 miles.</p>

               <p>SAba is a metropolitan city in Ethiopia, lying beyond Egypt, 846 miles from Ieruſalem towards the South: and tooke the name from a certain pretious ſtone called Achates, wherin might plainly be diſcerned in certain diſtinct colors, the riſing of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the chanels of riuers, high mountains, and ſomtimes of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots and horſes drawing them. It is reported, That
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of the Epirots had one of them, wherein was liuely repreſented the nine Muſes, and <hi>Apollo</hi> playing on the Viol, portrayed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſtaines and colours, ſo artificially, as if they had bin don by ſome curious workman. Of this ſtone you may reade more in <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, li.</hi> 37. <hi>ca.</hi> 1.10. It was firſt found in Achates a riuer of Sicilia, whence it tooke the name. Afterward in India and Phrygia, and of the Hebrewes was called Schaeba or Saba. In this city that Queen dwelt who came to heare <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſedom, and gaue him for a preſent 120 talents of pure gold, which at 3 pounds an ounce comes to 270000 pounds ſterling. Afterwards <hi>Cambyſes</hi> King of Perſia ouercame it and all the country round about it, and after his ſiſters name called it Meroës. It is a ſtately city to this day, ſcituated in a plain country, and compaſſed about with the riuer Nilus like an Iſland, being now called Elſaba, hauing ſome affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to the antient name Saba.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of this towne goe naked, all but their priuy parts, which they couer either with Silke, Cotton, or ſome more coſtly matter; and are of a blacke colour, which as ſome thinke,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7153:107"/> hapneth by reaſon of the extreme heat. The land alſo is maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſcortched, and turned in many places to ſand and duſt. So that the country is thereby wonderfull barren.</p>
               <p>About Meroes or Saba, which is made fruitful by the inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nilus, there is found plenty of ſalt, braſſe, yron, and ſome pretious ſtones. Their ſheep, goats, oxen, and other cattell are of leſſe ſtature than in other Countries. Their dogs are very fierce and cruell.</p>
               <p>In times paſt there were mighty princes that had the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and command of it, and the Country round about it. But after (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 29.) it was in the juriſdiction and gouernment of Queenes, who for their noble reſolutions &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage were called <hi>Candaces.</hi> One of which name in <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperours time was famous, both for the extent of her domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (in which ſhe exceeded all the reſt of her predeceſſors) as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in regard of her manly preſence and noble ſpirit. The Eunuch which
<hi>Philip</hi> baptiſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. was Treaſurer or Chamberlain to this Queene: and it is to be thought, By him the doctrine of the Goſpell of Chriſt was firſt made knowne in Saba, and in the countrey of Aethiopia; which afterwards was more largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated and diſperſed by the Evangeliſt S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> who taught there.</p>
               <p>This city lieth to the longitude of 61 degrees and 30 ſcruples, &amp; in the eleuation of the Pole Artick to the latitude 16 degrees and 25 ſcruples. So that it ſeemes the inhabitants haue two win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; two ſummers, or rather a continual ſummer, becauſe their winter is much hotter than our ſummer. But when the Sunne at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the 15 degree of <hi>Taurus</hi> and
<hi>Leo,</hi> and in the Dog daies, it then lies perpendicular ouer that country, and neither their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies nor houſes giue any ſhadowes.</p>
               <p>In the 61 of <hi>Eſay</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall come from Saba, and bring gold &amp; frankincenſe to praiſe the Lord.</hi> From whence ſome ſome haue concluded, That thoſe wiſe men which came vnto the childe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and brought Gold, Frankincenſe, and Myrrh, were Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and came thence. But this agreeth not well with the words of <hi>Mathew, ca.</hi> 2. where it is written, That the wiſe men came out of the Eaſt, that is, from the riſing of the Sun, to Ieruſalem. For
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7153:107"/> Saba, according to our Sauiors words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. lieth towards the South; for he ſaith, <hi>The Queen of the South</hi> (that is, of Saba) <hi>ſhall come forth in the day of Iudgement againſt this generation, and condemne it, for ſhe came from the end of the world to heare the wiſedome of</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if Saba lie vpon the South, as here it plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, then it muſt needs follow they came not thence, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Perſia, which from Ieruſalem lies Eaſtward. For at Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa the metropolis of that country, there was an Academy for the whole kingdom; in which were chiefly ſtudied Diuinity, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematickes, and Hiſtory. So that it is likely, by their Art they might attain to the knowledge of this diuine Myſterie, and from thence come to Ieruſalem, which was 520 miles Eaſtward. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this place of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> is rather to be referred to the propagation of the church through the whole world, where ſome of euery nation ſhall bring preſents vnto the Lord.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another Saba in Arabia Foelix, ſo called from <hi>Zaeba</hi> the ſon of
<hi>Chus,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cham,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Noah;</hi> and it is diſtant from Ieruſalem 1248 miles toward the Southeaſt. In He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew it ſignifies the city of Drunkenneſſe, or of Mirth; but with the Syrians, Antiquitie. Some would haue it in the Arabian tongue to ſignifie a Myſterie. But S. <hi>Ierom</hi> interprets it, To ſound their conuerſion. It is the metropolitan City of Arabia Foelix, and by <hi>Strabo, lib.</hi> 6. called Meriaba, being ſcituated in a high and pleaſant mountain full of fruitfull trees.</p>
               <p>There inhabiteth in it the King of that countrey (a mightie Prince) his Gouernors, and moſt of ſuch as haue authority vnder him. The land is called the Kingdome of the Sabaeans, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, Arabia Foelix, becauſe of the fertilitie of the place; for it yeeldeth twice euery yeare great plenty of Frankincenſe, Myrrh, Cinnamon, Balſam, and other odoriferous herbs. The tree out of which this Myrrh commeth is fiue cubits high, hairy, and full of prickles, and when you cut the barke there commeth forth a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gumme, wherewith if you anoint a dead body, it will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long without rotting. The frankincenſe alſo that is found there, droppeth from Cedar trees like a glewie ſubſtance, and ſo congealeth into a Gum. This happeneth twice euery yeare, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7153:108"/> according vnto the ſeaſon it changeth colour: in the Spring it is red, in the Summer white. This is the beſt Frankincenſe in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia Foelix. Through the whole country there is a very delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſmell, by reaſon of the Myrrh, Frankincenſe and Cinnamon that is found in it; inſomuch that if the winde blowes amongſt the trees it carrieth the ſmell vnto the red ſea, and they that ſaile can eaſily diſcerne the ſweetneſſe of the aire. There is gold alſo found there, very fine and pure, inſomuch as for the goodneſſe of it, it is called Arabian gold. The Phoenix is found there, of which there is but one in the world. <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 35. deſcribes her to be as big as an Eagle, with a liſt of feathers like gold about her necke, the reſt are of a purple colour; therefore from Phoenicea and the purple colour of her wings ſhee is called Phoenix. Shee hath a tuft of feathers vpon her head like vnto a crowne. Shee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth 660 yeares, at the end of which time ſhe buildeth her a neſt of Caſſia, Cinnamon, Calamus, and other pretious Gummes and herbs, which the Sun by the extremitie of the heate and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of her wings fires; and ſhe taking delight in the ſweetneſſe of the ſauor, houers ſo long ouer it, that ſhe burnes her ſelfe in her owne neſt. Within a while after, out of the marrow of her bones, and the aſhes of her body, there groweth a worme, which by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little increaſeth to ſome bigneſſe, and after to a purple bird. Then her wings extend themſelues to a full greatneſſe, till ſuch time as ſhe commeth to be a perfect Phoenix.</p>
               <p>This Bird doth liuely repreſent our Sauiour Chriſt, who only and alone is the true Meſſiah, and through whom we muſt expect euerlaſting life, who in the fulneſſe of time offered himſelf a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vpon the Croſſe, ſuſtaining the puniſhment for ſin at the time of his Paſſion, putting on a purple robe, being all be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with his owne bloud, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. And as the Phoenix is burnt in her owne neſt, ſo likewiſe was hee conſumed in the fire of Gods wrath, according to that in the 22 <hi>Pſal. My heart is become like mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wax in the middeſt of my body.</hi> And as the Phoenix of it ſelfe begetteth another of the ſame kinde; ſo Chriſt by the power of his Deitie raiſed vp his body from the duſt of the earth, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vp into heauen a glorious body, to ſit at the right hand
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7153:108"/> of his father in that euerlaſting Kingdome of glory.</p>
               <p>Thus (gentle Reader) I thought fit to deſcribe vnto you theſe two townes, that when you ſhall reade of them in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (the one being in Aethiopia towards the South, the other in Arabia <hi>Foelix,</hi> and called Seba) you might diſcerne the one from the other: of both which there is mention in the 72 <hi>Pſalme, The Kings of the Sea and of the Iſles ſhall bring preſents; the Kings of Saba, and Seba, ſhall giue gifts.</hi>

The greateſt part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the firſt yeare of this King hapned in the yeare of the world 3033, and before Chriſt 935. Hee reigned ouer Iſrael 25 yeares, that is, from the 35 of his age, till the 60. In the 7 yeare of his reigne hee went from Ieruſalem to Samaria, which was 32 miles, to viſit his kinſman <hi>Ahab</hi> King of Iſrael: for <hi>Ioram</hi> his ſon ſome ten yeares before had maried <hi>Athaliah</hi> King
<hi>Ahabs</hi> Siſter, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8.</p>

               <p>From Ieruſalem hee went to the city of Beerſaba, the vtmoſt bounds of his kingdome towards the South, to inſtruct his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Law of the Lord; which was 42 miles from Ieruſalem Southward.</p>
               <p>From Beerſaba, paſſing through all his kingdome hee came to Mount Ephraim, which was 48 miles, and the vtmoſt bounds of his kingdome Northward, beeing ſome 8 miles from Ieruſalem, 2
<hi>Chr.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>From Mount Ephraim he went to Ieruſalem, which was eight miles. Thus <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> went through al his dominions, to inſtruct his ſubjects in pietie and the true worſhip of God: In euery Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ordaining Iudges and Gouernours, Magiſtrates, Procurators, and Aſſeſſors, committing to their diſcretion the deciding of all controuerſies; ſaying to them, <hi>Take heed what you doe, for the office which you haue taken vpon you is not humane, but Diuine: and as you iudge, ſo ſhall you bee iudged; for the Lord is with you in iudgement.

This fight happened in a faire vally between Tecoa and Engedi. So <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> purſued the enemy for three daies with great ſlaughter, and returned with a mighty ſpoile. This was called the valley of Bleſſing, becauſe of this great victorie at Tecoa, and began 8 miles from Ieruſalem Southeaſtward, and extended it ſelfe to the tower of Engedi neer to the banke of the red ſea, 20 miles.</p>

               <p>In the 11 yere of this king, Ieruſalem was taken by <hi>Nabuchado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi> the great Emperour of the Babylonians: wherefore <hi>Zedeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> to eſcape the brunt of war, fled from Ieruſalem with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeed to Iericho, which was 12 miles, <hi>Ier.</hi> 39.52.</p>

               <p>From Riblah (after the Emperour <hi>Nabuchadonezar,</hi> had cauſed all his children to be put to death before his face, and had put out both his eyes) he led him captiue to Babylon, which was

So changing M into L, it is called Chaldeus or Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea. The chiefe and Metropolitan citie of which countrie, was this Babylon, built ſome thirtie yeares after the floud by <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> or the Babylonian Saturne, the firſt great commander of the world, according to <hi>Beroſus lib.</hi> 4. who writeth after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>Nimrod</hi> which was accounted the ſonne of <hi>Iupiter Belus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angry with the holy Prieſts of that great God Iehouah, came with his colonie and people into the field of Sinear, where hee built a citie, and laid the foundation of a great tower, 131 yeares after the floud; and raiſed this tower to ſuch a height, and withall of ſuch a hugeneſſe, that it ſeemed as if it had beene ſome great mountaine; becauſe he would haue the Babylonian people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the chiefeſt and greateſt in the world; alſo their gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the King of Kings. A little after he ſaith, he built this tower, but before he could finiſh it, dyed, in the 56 yeare aftet he began it: wherefore the citie and tower of Babylon, according to the opinion of <hi>Beroſus,</hi> was begun in <hi>Anno mundi,</hi> 1788, which was 131 yeares after the flood, and before Chriſt, 2180. There were two cauſes wherefore the children of men built vp this Tower; firſt, that they might get them a name: ſecondly, that they might be ſafe in caſe there came another flood to drowne the world. It was made of bricke and bittume, leaſt the water ſhould looſen it. But the Lord turned their enterpriſes into euill, and diuided their Language, ſo that they could not vnderſtand one another [whereby they were conſtrained to leaue off their building:] from whence it happened that their mindes, manners, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, ſtudies, and principall actions were vtterly changed, and is the foundation of all diſcord and ſedition, where the feare of God, and the true knowledge of Chriſt doth not preuent it. From this diuiſion of tongues, it is called the citie of Babylon, this is, the citie of diuiſion, being deriued of the word <hi>Balal,</hi> he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded or mingled together. Of this city you may reade in <hi>Ioſ. lib.</hi> 1.
<hi>cap.</hi> 9. where he bringeth in a ſaying of the Sibels, which
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7153:131"/> was, <hi>That when all nations were of one language, they built an exceeding high tower, as though they would haue aſcended by it into heauen; but the Lord, with great tempeſt and diuiding their tongues, ſubuerted their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, from whence it was called Babylon.</hi> This citie was the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in thoſe times of all others, ſcituated in a ſpacious plaine, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery ſide whereof, there ſtood pleaſant orchards and gardens: it was built foure ſquare, compaſſed about with wals of an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible ſtrength and greatneſſe, being 50 cubits thicke, and 200 high, beautified within with goodly buildings, fair temples rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilt with gold, and wonderfull to looke vpon. It was in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe 380 furlongs, as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith, which make 48 miles. Through it ran the riuer Euphrates, by which all things neceſſarie were conueyed to the Citie: without it was compaſſed with faire ditches fil'd with water like riuers, and in the wall there ſtood a hundred gates.
<hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith, That it was 480 furlongs about, which make 60 miles Engliſh, but that is not ſo credible.</p>
               <p>The firſt founder of this citie was <hi>Nimrod,</hi> who in thoſe times was the chiefe commander of the world. It is thought that he was the ſonne of <hi>Cham,</hi> the ſonne of
<hi>Noah;</hi> whoſe name ſignifies, a cruell gouernor, or an vnmercifull tyrant. And that his actions might be according to the ſignification of his name, he is bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with moſt perſpicuous note of cruelty, omitting no violent action whereby he might enlarge his dominions; incroching vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other mens gouerments, through a thirſtie and ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of renowne, without either reſpect of equitie or humanitie. And to adde euill to euill, committed many outrages vpon ſuch as were accounted good men, and the Prieſts of the great God Iehouah, from whence there grew in him a more than humane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, accounting himſelfe in this world a god, and through this opinion grew into contempt of all good things; compelling ſuch as were his ſubjects and vaſſals to do him worſhip and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as to a diuine power; which, being ingraffed into the hearts of ſuch as followed in ſucceeding ages, they countenanced it with authority: from whence it came to paſſe, that he was inrolled into the number of their principall gods, giuing him the name of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, whom the Hebrewes calleth Sudormin, which elegantly imployeth Saturne.</p>

This man ſo much inlarged the Citie, that many in ſucceeding ages haue attributed the foundation thereof vnto him. He ruled ouer it ſixtie and one yeares.</p>
               <p>After him ſucceeded <hi>Ninus,</hi> or as ſome will haue it <hi>Nimrod</hi> the ſecond, who began his raigne <hi>Anno mundi,</hi> 1909, before Chriſt, 2061: he did many worthy acts during his life, and added to the Empire of Babylon many Prouinces; and after hee had raigned 50 yeares, dyed, and was buried in Babylon.</p>
               <p>After him ſucceeded <hi>Semiramis</hi> his wife, who tooke vpon her the gouernement of the Aſſirian Empire, her ſonne <hi>Ninus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then within age; and ſhe began her gouernment <hi>Anno mundi,</hi> 1959, before Chriſt, 2009. Shee was one of the manlieſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute women that we reade of, and performed as many worthy and memorable actions. This Queene built her ſepulchre ouer the moſt eminent gate of Babylon, in a publike and perſpicuous place, vpon which ſhee cauſed to be written in golden letters, <hi>If there be any King of Babylon that ſhall come after me, and ſtand in need of mony, let him open this ſepulchre, and whatſoeuer he wanteth hee ſhall finde: but before, it will not be good for him to touch it.</hi> This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, it continued till the raigne of <hi>Darius,</hi> who opened this monument in hope to finde what the ſuperſcription impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but no money was there to bee had, onely within might plainely be ſeene engrauen other letters, to this effect: <hi>Vnleſſe thou hadſt beene vnſatiably couetous, thou wouldeſt neuer haue opened the graues of the dead in hope of gaine.</hi> This woman beautified Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon with many goodly buildings, built vp the walles thereof, ſet a bridge ouer Euphrates, made a beautifull Orchard and a Garden in it, beautified it with many goodly Towers and fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, added vnto it many prouinces and gouernments: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, becauſe of her owne laſciuious appetite (as <hi>Salluſt</hi> ſaith) was murthered by her ſon <hi>Ninus,</hi> who ſucceeded her in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</p>
               <p>There were many other memorable things within this Citie, that were built before and after her time (as <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith) as that great and mighty tower before remembred, in which ſtood
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7153:132"/> the temple of <hi>Baelus,</hi> and his ſepulchre. Not far from that ſtood a chappell, wherein was the ſtatue of <hi>Iupiter</hi> all of pure gold, worth
<note n="*" place="margin">What this was in our mony you may ſee after.</note> 800 talents of gold. Without that chappell there ſtood an altar of pure gold, vpon which they yearely offered 100000 talents of frankincenſe. There was another alſo ſomwhat leſſe, vpon which they vſed to offer their ſacrifices; for it was not lawfull for them to offer any thing that had life vpon the greater altar: there ſtood alſo in that place another ſtatue twelue cubits high, all of pure gold.</p>
               <p>This City was after taken by <hi>Cyrus</hi> the firſt Emperour of the Perſians, <hi>Anno mundi</hi> 3432. before Chriſt 536. in the ſeuentieth yeare after the Captiuitie of Iſrael and Iudah, according to the prophecie of <hi>Ieremy;</hi> at which time the City was ſo great, that they which dwelt in the middle of it did not know that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie had entred within the walls at the further end: which might happen, becauſe vpon that day when it was taken the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans celebrated a Feaſt vnto <hi>Venus,</hi> in which vſing extraordinarie diligence, they were leſſe mindfull of ſuch things as hapned vnto them.</p>
               <p>Thus this City, that with great tyranny had triumphed ouer the Nations of the earth for the ſpace of 1600 yeares (being ſo plentifully furniſhed with all things neceſſary for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of life, that the inhabitants therof contemned al other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) was by Gods permiſſion, for their pride and preſumption, waſted and conſumed by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as you haue heard: and ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vtterly deſtroyed by <hi>Xerxes,</hi> the fourth Emperor of the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ſo continueth to this day, as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith.

               <p>From Lachis hee went to Libnah, 8 miles. This was a ſtrong Hold, but he beſieged it ſo narrowly, that within a while after he had begun the ſiege, he tooke it. While he was before this town there came newes, That <hi>Taracha</hi> a King of the Ethiopians had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded his country. Wherefore he ſent the ſecond time meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Ieruſalem. But the Lord was offended with their blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, wherefore hee ſent his Angell, who in one night deſtroyed 185000 of his army.</p>
               <p>This ſudden and vnexpected euill falling upon him, in a great feare he returned to Niniveh,
692 miles, where he was ſlain by his ſons in the Temple. The ſame of theſe things was ſo divulged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that <hi>Herodotus, lib.</hi> 2. makes mention of them.</p>

               <p>From whence it plainely appeareth, that the Prophet <hi>Eſaias</hi> was of the ſtocke of
<hi>Dauid,</hi> and linage of Chriſt; for which cauſe in the fifth chapter of his prophecie, he calleth him his beloued. He began to teach publiquely in the yeare of the World, 3167, and before Chriſt 800, and gouerned the Church eighty yeares and more, vntill the time of
<hi>Manaſſes,</hi> who cauſed him to be cut in pieces with a ſaw.</p>
               <p>In <hi>anno mundi</hi> 3190: before Chriſt, 778, <hi>Iſay</hi> ſaw the Lord ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon a high throne in great majeſtie, the lower part whereof filled the Temple, and the Saraphins compaſſed him round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 6. Cherubins are glorious and bright ſhining Angels, of a fiery nature: For <hi>Saraph</hi> ſignifieth, He hath turned to fire.</p>
               <p>His doctrine was two fold, that is, partly concerning the Law, partly the Goſpell, as may appeare by his prophecie: in the firſt forty chapters whereof, the doctrine of the law is ſet forth with ſharpe reprehenſions for ſinne: in the firſt foure of which, are grieuous accuſations of ſinners for breach of the firſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; the other for the moſt part prophecie of horrible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, mutations, and change of gouernement; but principally, of the Iewes, Babylonians, Aſſirians, Syrians, and Aegyptians. From the fortieth to the end of the booke is contained the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell, and of the Kingdome of our Sauiour
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7153:143"/> Ieſus Chriſt; which hee hath ſet forth with ſuch excellent elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, figures, and amplifications, that hee may be compared with the beſt Orator that euer wrote.</p>

It is reported that the gate whereby they entred into this orchard, was very curiouſly built, ſupported with pillars of poliſhed marble, imboſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſiluer and gold very rare to looke vpon: ouer it was a banqueting houſe, beautified with liuely pictures, coſtly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and beds of gold and ſiluer couered with rich tapeſtry, wrought with ſilke, ſiluer, and gold; vpon theſe they vſed to eate their banquets: it was paued with Porphire Marble, and Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinths, in ſuch ſort, as it greatly delighted ſuch as beheld it. The Queene had a priuate garden to her ſelfe.

300 yeares after the floud, and 2000 before Chriſt, about the time when the Patriarch
<hi>Abraham</hi> was borne. It continued in great glory for the ſpace almoſt of 1500 yeares, and was diſtant from Ieruſalem to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Northeaſt 684 miles: vpon the Eaſt ſide ioyning to the riuer Tygris, on the North to the Caſpian ſea. It takes the name from the beauty of it, being deriued of <hi>Navah,</hi> which ſignifieth A comely place ſpatious and pleaſant. There are many that are of opinion that in many things it exceeded Babylon; as, for the ſumptuouſneſſe of the buildings, the ſtrength of the Walls, and the extent. The walls were ſo thicke that three Chariots might haue met vpon them without any danger; and beautified with an hundred and fifty towers. <hi>Ionas</hi> being ſent of God to this city,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7153:150"/> was three daies going through it, that is (as <hi>Luther</hi> expounds it) through euery ſtreet of it; in which time he conuerted a hundred and twenty thouſand to repentance. <hi>Arbaces</hi> (who was alſo called <hi>Arphaxad</hi>) was then Emperor. This
<hi>Arbaces, Iuſtine lib.</hi> 2. calleth <hi>Arbactus:</hi> he was a Captaine of the Medes, who perceiuing the effeminat diſpoſition of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> the then Emperour, taking aduantage of the times, and this mans weakneſſe, conſpired with ſome of his companions to vſurp vpon his gouernment: and that he might make them hate and loath his looſeneſſe, brought them into a room where the might ſee him ſitting amongſt his harlots, tyred in womans apparell, and carding wooll. This ſight greatly diſpleaſing them, and before being encouraged by <hi>Arbactus,</hi> they ſeiſed vpon the city, and beſieged <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> in his palace. But to preuent the miſerie of a ſhameful death, after he had gathered all his riches together, he ſet fire on his palace, where he, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and treaſure periſhed. This fire continued 15 daies, and hapned 823 yeares before Chriſt: about which time <hi>Arbactus</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> began to reign, and continued his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 28 yeres. But the Medes held not the Aſſyrian Empire long; for <hi>Phul Belochus</hi> who at this time reigned in Babylon, and his ſucceſſour <hi>Tiglath Philaſſer,</hi> are called Kings of Aſſyria, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene whom there hapned many great Warres, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 15.26.

                  <p>Thus was this city greatly defaced with continuall euills, the Lord before hand giuing them many admonitions and gentle corrections (if it had bin in them to haue conceiued it) to winne them to repentance; but they continued ſtill in their ſins, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to their former prophecies, <hi>Cyaxares</hi> King of the Medes beſieging this towne, tooke it and deſtroyed it euen vnto the ground, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith.

But in reſpect of the former Niniveh it ſeemes a ſmall village. It hath a bridge built of ſhips, lying vpon the Eaſt ſide of it ouer the riuer Tygris; and vpon that ſide of the Riuer there ſtand many faire gardens and orchards; and the land there alſo is very fertil and pleaſant. But vpon the Weſt of Tygris the ſoile is nothing ſo fruitfull. At this day it is called by the name of Moſſel; ſo that although it ſtands in the ſame place, yet doth it not retain the ſame name. To this towne there is a great reſort of merchants, who bring vp their commodities from the Riuer Tygris hither, and from hence conuey them to Bagdeth &amp; many other parts of the world.

               <p>From Ioppa hee went to Ieruſalem, which was 20 miles, where <hi>Iaſon</hi> the high-Prieſt and all the people receiued him with great honour.

               <p>From Leuſia, <hi>Antiochus</hi> (fearing leſt the Iewes would forſake his Empire and rebell) went to Ieruſalem, which was 288 miles; but the inhabitants of the towne ſhut him out of the city, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he beſieged it, and by the treaſon of <hi>Menelaus</hi> chiefe Prieſt, (who for that purpoſe conſpired with the gard that was in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) quickly got it and entred the gates. In every place where he came hee put the Citiſens to the ſword, and for three daies ſpace did little elſe but cruelly maſſacre the people. He went alſo with
<hi>Menelaus</hi> into the Temple, where he polluted the ſacred things of the Temple, and took thence the veſſels of ſiluer &amp; gold, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he found pretious or worthy: ſo that the prey he tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to 1800 talents, which make almoſt 11 tunne of pure gold; all which were partly gifts dedicated to the Temple, and partly treaſure that was left there as in a ſafe and ſure place, to the vſe of poore diſtreſſed widowes and orphans.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Antiochus</hi> had robbed the Temple of all the ſiluer and gold that he could finde, had baniſhed <hi>Iaſon,</hi> had placed a ſtrong garriſon in the tower of Acropolis, (the captaine of which was one <hi>Philip</hi> a very cruell man) and made <hi>Menelaus</hi> high-Prieſt; with all this booty and ſome number of captiues hee returned to Antiochia, which was 280 miles. In the yeare following, that is, before Chriſt 166, <hi>Lu. Aemilius Paulus</hi> triumphed for the wars of Macedonia. Not long after, <hi>Antiochus</hi> miſdoubting the fidelitie of the Iewes, ſent <hi>Apolonius</hi> with an army of 22000 to Ieruſalem, who entred the city vpon the Sabbath day, and committed many outrages.</p>
               <p>Then, <hi>Antiochus</hi> hauing ſpent a great part of the gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer which he had got from Ieruſalem, about the eleuenth yeare of his reigne made his expedition from Antiochiato, Perſepolis, (it was alſo called Elymaides) in Perſia, which was 196 miles.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7153:168"/> Here he took the temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> ſpoiled all that country round about, and with ſtrong hand gathered together a great maſſe of gold and ſiluer to maintain warre againſt <hi>Iudas Machabeus.</hi> But a multitude of citiſens diſliking his ſacriledge, banded themſelues together, and put <hi>Antiochus</hi> and his ſouldiers to flight before hee could take the city of Perſepolis. 1 <hi>Mach.</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Mach.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Wherefore being driuen from thence, he fled with his army to Egbatana, a city in Media, which was 209 miles. Here hauing certain intelligence by letters, of the noble exploits of <hi>Iudas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabeus,</hi> and that he purged the temple of ſuch things as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, he fell into an extreme griefe, and like one diſtracted rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt the Iewes, and ſwore to be reuenged of them, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In this extreme anger he went from Egbatana to Babylon with his army, which was 464 miles. But as he went, his Chariot was ouerthrown, in the fall wherof he was ſo extremely wounded, that they were conſtrained to carry him in a bed to Babylon, where he ſhortly after died miſerably.</p>
               <p>So all his trauels were 8153 miles.</p>
               <p>Thus may we ſee with what difficulties and dangers this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked prince obtained his victories, and paſt away his life, ſomtime in trauel, his journies long and troubleſome, ſomtimes in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ſomtimes in aduerſitie, again ſomtimes afflicted with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome cogitations, ſometimes with extreame anger, ſeldome in peace, and then alſo his actions ſauoring of violence and filthines From whence it appeareth, That the wicked with more ſorowes, troubles, and vexations gaine eternall damnation; than the Iuſt, though they ſuffer many grieuous afflictions, obtain euerlaſting ſaluation.

                  <p>ANtiochia, where <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> kept his court, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently called Chaemath, or Riblah. It was ſcituated in Syria, 180 miles from Ieruſalem towards the North, neer to the Cities Seleucia, Laodicea, and Apamea, which foure Cities (as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith in the ſixteenth Booke of his Geographie) was built by <hi>Seleucus Nicanor</hi> firſt King of Syria. This man was a mighty Prince; and obtained the name of <hi>Nicanor</hi> (which ſignifieth Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie) becauſe he proſpered in his warres, and conquered his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. For when (within 13 yeares after the death of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great) hee had got the kingdome of Syria, hee became ſo great in the 31 yeare of his reign, that he obtained the empire of all the Eaſt; and beſide (as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith) re-edified and built vp theſe foure cities, calling one of them Antiochia, after the name of his father, another Laodicea after the name of his mother, a third after his own name Seleucia, and the laſt Apamea, after the name of his wife. Theſe foure cities, becauſe they were all built by one man and at one time, were called Siſters. But Antiochia was much fairer than the other, and in thoſe times was a greater city than any other called after that name, yea it was equal to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria in Egypt, for glory and excellencie of building. It was diuided into foure parts, and thoſe parts ſeperated with four wals: The firſt, which was antiently called Hemath (A violent anger) of <hi>Chamathai</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Canaan;</hi> was after Riblath, from the multitude of the inhabitants; and the third time by <hi>Seleucus,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his fathers name, called Antiochia. In this part
<hi>Seleucus</hi> to dignifie the City, kept his court, it being compaſſed about with goodly walls. In the ſecond part the citiſens of Syria inhabited. In the third, <hi>Seleucus Callimichus</hi> (afterward King of the Syrians) kept his court, and greatly beautified it. But in the fourth (where afterward many Chriſtians inhabited) <hi>Antigonus Epiphanes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and did greatly adorn it and ſet it forth with goodly buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and ſumptuous houſes. Cloſe by the Citie there ſtood a
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7153:169"/> pleaſant wood watered with many cleare fountains and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſprings, to which there reſorted a great multitude of Fowles of diuers ſorts, which ſung very pleaſantly among the trees, to the great content and delectation of the citiſens. In the midſt of this wood ſtood the temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> goodly things, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry curiouſly built. It was called the wood of <hi>Daphne,</hi> becauſe it was full of Laurel trees. From this wood all the countrey therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout is called Epidaphne.

                  </p>
                  <p>This city of Perſepolis was ſo fair, that it exceeded all the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Eaſt, both for ſtatelineſſe and beauty, and ſo continued from <hi>Perſeus</hi> time, vntill
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had conquered <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius:</hi> at which time this great Emperor hauing got into his hand the whole empire of the Perſians, came to Perſepolis in the yeare before Chriſt 329, and there celebrated a great feaſt in triumph of his victories; to which there reſorted a great many women, not ſuch as were of the better ſort, but them that followed the camp, and liued diſſolutely: amongſt whom was that notable cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſan
<hi>Thais;</hi> who perceiuing the King inclined to mirth, and full with wine, began to flatter him in his cups, &amp; among other things to commend and dignifie his noble exploits; withall giuing him to vnderſtand, how acceptable it would be to the Grecians, to ſee that royall palace of the Perſians fired, which had ſo often affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Grecia. No ſooner had ſhe vttered theſe words, but another ſeconded her, and then a third. After, the whole aſſembly cried out, Shall we reuenge the injurie of Grecians, and burn the city? with that they al roſe in great fury, the king himſelf (being crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) beginning firſt to fire the palace, wherein was great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Cedar, from whence it happened that ſuddenly the fire
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7153:170"/> ſpred it ſelfe a great way; which when the army that lay without the walls perceiued, with all ſpeed came to the city to ſtay the burning of it, for which purpoſe many brought water with them. But when they beheld the King himſelfe buſie in this tragedie, laying aſide their water, they alſo, in hope of booty, and to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the ſteps of their Prince, fell to firing the city, and according to the cuſtom of ſoldiers in ſuch maſſacres, made a prey of what they could get; increaſing the fire with dry ſtuffe and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible matter, whereby it came to paſſe that the whole city was therewith fired, and burnt to the ground. This was the end of that mighty city which ruled ouer ſo many nations, where ſo many mighty Princes gouerned, that was the ſcourge of Grecia and the greateſt part of the world, that ſent forth a Navie of 10000 ſhips and an army of an infinit number; there being at this day nothing to be ſeen, vnleſſe the riuer Araxes that ran cloſe by it remaineth. Thus was that conſumed in a fury, which the King and all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my before endeauoured to ſpare. But after it turned to the great ſhame of the Macedonians, that their King ſhould fire ſo famous a city in the midſt of his cups: and <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelfe after hee had ſlept repented what he had done.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall find in 2 <hi>Mac. cap.</hi> 6. That <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a certaine City in Perſia called Perſepolis, from whence for his exceeding couetouſneſſe and ſacriledge he was forced by the inhabitants dwelling about the town to raiſe his ſiege &amp; be gon. Therefore ſome may gather, that this Perſepolis before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned was rebuilded, becauſe it alſo ſtood in Perſia: but if you read 1 <hi>Mac. cap.</hi> 6. you ſhall finde that this city ſo beſieged by <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> was alſo called Elymais, wherein ſtood the temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> beautified with goodly ornaments, ſhining with the ſplendor of fine gold wherewith it was gilt. In which temple, as faith <hi>Ioſephus lib. Ant.</hi> 12.
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great left his armor and other things. From whence may be gathered, that this towne was not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſepolis which he cauſed to be burnt, but rather ſome other towne built out of the ruines of that city (according to the opinion of <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi>) or elſe ſome village ſtanding neere to it, which being built vp and inlarged, might of ſome be called new Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7153:171"/> though indeed it was antiently called Elymais, and all the Eaſt part of Perſia beyond Suſa, of that towne called Elematica, hauing ſome affinitie with Elam the antient name of Perſia, ſo called of <hi>Elam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Sem, Gen.</hi> 10.

               <p>THe Hebrew talent ordinarily weigheth 125 pounds, which being diuided, amounteth to 3000 ſicles or halfe ounces, as it plainly appeareth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 38.25, 26. where it is ſaid that 600000 men offered ſo many halfe ſicles, which make 300000 ſicles, the 100 part of which make a talent, from whence it appeareth that 3000 ſicles make a talent.

1200 Drachma's, which make the ſame weight, and is worth 375 li. of Engliſh mony. But the Hebrew Talent of gold, which for the moſt part is vſed in euery place, is worth 4500 li. in our mony.</p>
               <p>The Iewes had three ſorts of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents:

               <head>Of gold weights which were not originally the Iewes, but borrowed of other Nations, and vſed amongst them.</head>
               <p>THere are four kindes of Weights that are mentioned in the Scriptures, which were common amongſt the Iewes, beſides the former, <hi>viz.</hi> Zahab, of which you may reade, 2
<hi>Kings,</hi> 5.5.
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7153:194"/> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 9.16. and is called by the name of a Nummus. The Sicle of gold, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 21.25. which is there alſo called Nummus. Both which being ſo called, ſeem to ſignifie a Didrachma of gold: and theſe two were properly belonging to the Iewes. The other that follow belonged not to them, but they receiued them from other nations; as the Stater, Drachmon, and Adarchon.</p>
               <p>The Stater was an antient piece of gold common amongſt the Perſians, Grecians, Romans, and other great gouernments, being diſtinguiſhed by the ſuperſcription of the Kings or Countries where they were made or coined; as the Stater Philippici, Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci, Alexandrei, Romani, &amp;c. They were pure fine gold, ſome of which were as much in value as a double ducat, others as 4 Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian ducats, and ſome as Portagues.</p>
               <p>The Drachmon (of which you may reade, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is a Perſian coin as it ſeems, for the Grecian interpreters cal it <hi>Drach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> which is as much more as the Attick Drachma, and in our mony is worth 7 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Adarcon alſo ſeemes to be a Perſian coine, and doth imply the name of a prince, or Daricum ſignifies the gold of the Perſians: For <hi>Darius</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hyſtaſpis</hi> then reigned, when theſe Nummus of gold thus called, were dedidated to the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and this man for the moſt part coined ſingular good gold, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Herod. in Melp. Plut. in Artax.</note> wherfore they were either called Darici, becauſe they were coined by the Perſian kings; or els, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerues, becauſe the image of <hi>Darius</hi> ſtood vpon one part of it. And was worth of our mony 7 s.
6 d.</p>
               <p>Thus you may perceiue what diuerſities of weights were vſed amongſt the Iewes; being crept in amongſt them partly becauſe of their captiuitie, and partly becauſe of their commerce &amp; trade with other Nations. It is therefore worthy of obſeruation, that if at any time you reade of any weight of mony, braſſe, or the like in the holy Scripture, to conſider of what ſort of weight it is, <hi>viz.</hi> whether a Weight of the Iewes, or ſome forreine and ſtrange Weight. If of the Iewes, Whether it be a common Sicle, the Kings ſicle, or the ſicle of the Temple. But if theſe may bee diſcerned, you ſhall for the moſt part finde the Addition, which may eaſily diſtinguiſh them. But if there be no addition, that is,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7153:194"/> the Kings ſicle, or the ſicle of the Temple, then you may preſume that it is the common ſicle. And ſo for other weights &amp; monies.</p>

                  <hi>Cicero</hi> in his 8 oration for <hi>Verres</hi> writes, that a Modius of wheat (which was a peck wanting a pint) was commonly ſold in Sicilia for 3 Seſtertio's, about 6 d. ſterling, and ſo much had euery ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant in Grecia dayly, and a pinte of wine to drinke.</p>
               <p>Theſe cuſtomes, howſoeuer in theſe countries they might bee tolerable, in regard they liued in a hot climat; yet to vs, where it is much colder, our bodies require a greater quantity for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: neuertheleſſe a mean and ſpare diet is both more healthful and profitable for the body, than exceſſe; becauſe the ſtomacke being ſurcharged, it canot duly concoct that which it receiueth, whereby the body is filled with many crudities and noiſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>

               <p>THere were two cities called by this name, the one Bethlem Iuda; the other Bethlem Euphrata where our ſauior Chriſt was borne, and ſignifies, fruitfull, or the houſe of Bread: It ſtood vpon a hil ſome 6 miles from Ieruſalem towards the South. The inhabitants take vpon them to ſhew the place where our ſauiour Chriſt was borne, which ſtood vpon the Eaſt ſide of the Citie, cloſe by the wall thereof; where as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſayth,
<hi>Hellen</hi> the Mother of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, cauſed to bee built a faire and ſtately Church, three hundred and twentie yeares after the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of Chriſt. This Church was dedicated to Saint <hi>Marie,</hi> and remaineth to this day, being had in great honour both amongſt the Chriſtians, and the Turkes and Sarazins. This Church is ſuch a ſtately building, that it is thought to exceede all the Churches of Chriſtendome, for beautie and curious workemanſhip: It is two hundred twentie and eight foot long, and eightie ſeuen foot wide, beeing built all of Marble of diuers colours, and couered with lead: There are in it foure rowes of Marble pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, wonderfull to looke vpon, not onely in regard of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but of their greatneſſe, for there is fiftie pillars in euery row. The body of this church, the pillars from the bottom to the top, the walls, and euerie part of it, is beautified with liuely pictures, adorned with diuers colours, ſiluer, gold, and curious workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſo as it is wonderfull to behold. The pauement of it is of marble; poliſhed, and of diuers colors, ſo cunningly ſet in workes, and with ſuch variety, that it is very delightful to ſuch as look on it. There is painted on the pillars and walls, almoſt all the ſtories of the Old Teſtament, till the birth of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, with ſuch excellent cunning, and ſo liuely, that it is to bee admired. In the Quire of this Church there is found two Altars, one cloſe by the Chappell of Saint <hi>Katherine,</hi> at the Eaſt end thereof; not far diſtant from which they ſhew the place
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:7153:214"/> where our Sauiour was circumciſed: and in the middle of the Quire there ſtandeth another Altar, where they ſay the wiſe men left their Dromedaries, and prepared their gifts to preſent vnto our Sauiour, when they worſhipped him. Vpon the South ſide of this quire towards the Eaſt, they deſcend by ten ſtone ſteps into the Chappell of the
<hi>Natiuitie of Chriſt,</hi> richly beautified and curiouſly wrought, paued with poliſhed Narble. This Chappell is not very great, but wonderfull faire and ſumptuous. When the Holy land was ouerrun by the Gentiles, this (as many other places were in that countrey) was all polluted with filth and dirt, that they had much adoe to make it cleane a great while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Vpon the place where they ſaid our Lady the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> brought forth our Sauiour into the world, there is placed a Table of white Marble, after the maner of an Altar: about ſome foure foot from this they ſhew the place where the Manger ſtood, a part of it yet remaining, cut out of a rocke, not of Marble but of other ſtone, as many other Mangers are in that countrey. Cloſe by that there is an Altar, where they ſay the wiſe-men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their gifts to our Sauiour Chriſt, and worſhipped him. At the entrance into the Church there ſtandeth a goodly building, which in times paſt ſeemed to haue been ſome Archbiſhops See, but now is called Saint

Round about this Tower were faire and fruitfull paſtures, to which many ſheepheards reſorted to feed their flockes; to ſome of which ſheepheards the Angels told the glad tidings of the birth of our Sauiour, and that he was laid in a Manger at Bethlehem.

<hi>Varinus,</hi> they were not only Philoſophers, but Prieſts alſo. And <hi>Plato</hi> vpon
<hi>Alcibiades,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Magia eſt deorum obſeruantia ſiue cultus diuinus;</hi> that is, <hi>Magicke preſcribeth the due obſeruance and diuine worſhip of the gods.

And when the ten Tribes were carried into captiuitie by <hi>Salmanaſſer</hi> Emperour of the Aſſirians (into Aſſiria, Media, and Perſia) there is no queſtion but they tooke with them into the Eaſt, the holy bookes and volumes of the Law and of the Prophets, whereby without doubt many of the people and Philoſophers of the Eaſt came to haue a taſte of the true knowledge and worſhip of God. Alſo the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> was brought vp in all the arts of the Chaldaeans; whoſe writings and prophecies were not only writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and publiſhed amongſt the Babylonians, but alſo had in great account and eſtimation amongſt the Magi: ſo that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently peruſing thoſe books, came not only to the knowledge of God, but alſo without doubt to the knowledge of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt, whom they called The Starre of <hi>Iacob;</hi> from whence may be concluded, That the Wiſe-men that came to ſee our Sauiour Chriſt, were rather of Suſa in Perſia, than of Zaba in Aethyopia.</p>
               <p>Wherefore theſe wiſe-men came from the Academy of Suſa

               <p>From Ieruſalem they went to Bethlehem, which was 6 miles, where vpon the ſixt of Ianuary they offered their Preſents which they brought out of Perſia, to our Sauior; <hi>viz.</hi> Gold, as to a King; Frankincenſe, as to a Prieſt; and Myrrhe, as to a mortall man,

               <head>The trauels of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Christ, from his Baptiſme till the firſt yeare of his Miniſtrie.</head>
               <p>CHriſt in the thirtieth yeare of his age, went from Nazereth and came to Bethabara, which ſtood vpon the riuer Iordan, where <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized; and vpon the ſeuenth day of October, in the middle of the laſt weeke ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel, cap.</hi> 9. was there baptized, at whoſe baptiſme the teſtimony of the ſpirit deſcended downe vpon him in the likeneſſe of a Doue; which was 52 miles.</p>
               <p>From Iordan, Ieſus was led by the ſpirit into the Wilderneſſe to be tempted of the diuell, and there faſted fortie daies and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nights: at the end of which time, the diuell came vnto and tempted him. How this wilderneſſe was called, the Euangeliſt doth not ſpecifie: but it is to be thought that it was the deſart of Arabia Petraea, &amp; that our Sauiour Chriſt faſted vpon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Sinai, where <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Eliah</hi> faſted fortie daies and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nights, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 19. For this deſart extendeth it ſelfe from the borders of Aegypt and the Red ſea, to Iordan, where <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized: and from thence by the country of Trachonitis, to the mountaine of Libanus. Therfore our Sauior Chriſt might that preſent ſeuenth day of Actober whereon he was baptiſed, come into this Wilderneſſe; and by little and little goe thence to mount Sanai, which was 136 miles. For there was no place more fit for Sathan to tempt our Sauiour in, than where the law was deliuered, which is the power of Sinne: for although the Son of God was without ſinne, yet he tooke vpon him the ſinnes of all the world, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. So then our Sauiour Chriſt (according to this ſupputation) continued in the Deſart from the ſeuenth day of October to the ſixteenth of Nouember, which was fortie daies and fortie nights. <hi>Epiphanias lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Hoereſ.</hi> 51. ſaith, that our Sauiour Chriſt was baptized vpon the eighth day of Nouember which was the twelfth day of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Athyr amongſt the Aegyptians: but this ſupputation is falſe
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:7153:220"/> and altogether repugnant to the certain Mathematicall calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Wherefore vpon the 17 day of Nouember our Sauior Chriſt hungred, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.
<hi>Mark</hi> 1. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. and then the diuel with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie boldneſſe came vnto him, and carried him from Mount Sinai with great violence through the aire, and ſet him vpon the top of a pinacle of the temple in Ieruſalem, which was 120 miles: this pinacle was ſo exceeding high (as you may reade in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Ieruſalem) that whoſoeuer looked down from it into the valley of Cedron, their eyes dazled, and it ſeemed as though there had bin clouds in the bottome of the valley; for it was 600 foot from the bottom to the top. From this place the diuell bad our Sauior Chriſt throw himſelfe downe, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>From the pinacle of the Temple the diuell tooke our Sauiour Chriſt and ſet him vpon a high mountaine; but what hill it was, or how called, the holy Euangeliſt doth not ſet down. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Holy land thinke it was the hil that ſtood betwixt Bethel and Ai, vpon which hill in times paſt <hi>Abraham</hi> dwelt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. But that hill is not very high, and there are many higher hils in the holy land: wherefore it is to be thought that he was caried vpon the top of that high mountain Nebo, which was alſo called Piſgah, and ſtood 24 miles from Ieruſalem Eaſtward, where God ſhewed vnto <hi>Moſes</hi> all the holy land beyond Iordan,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 34. and in this place, as God had ſhewed <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo the diuell ſhewed our Sauior the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, ſaying, <hi>All theſe will I giue thee, &amp;c.</hi> It is to be thought that all theſe ſharp temptations of the diuell were done in one day.</p>
               <p>This hill Piſgah is diſtant from Bethabara 8 miles, where <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> baptiſed, and bare witneſſe of our Sauior Chriſt, <hi>Ioh. ca.</hi> 1. Now after the diuel had left him, and the Angels had comforted him, he came thence vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> which was 8 miles, and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Behold, this is the Lambe of God which taketh away the ſinnes of the world, Ioh.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>So theſe trauels were 140 miles.</p>

               <p>After, he went thence with his mother and his diſciples to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum, 20 miles: but he ſtayed there but a while, for the paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer of the Iewes was at hand, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of Aprill Chriſt went from Capernaum to Ieruſalem, to the feaſt of the Paſſeouer, which was 56 miles, and there caſt out of the Temple the money-changers, and thoſe that ſold ſheepe, and oxen, and doues in it. This was done about 46 yeares after

At this time he continued in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem till the moneth of October, and there celebrated the Feaſt of Tabernacles, and preached the acceptable yeare of the Lord, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.</p>
               <p>The feaſt of Tabernacles being ended, Ieſus with his diſciples came into Iudea, that is, hee went from Ieruſalem, and began to teach in Iudea, and his Diſciples baptiſed,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed at this time vpon the borders of Galile neer Iudea, 42 miles from Ieruſalem Northward, vpon the Eaſt ſide of the riuer Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, for hee was not yet caſt into priſon. Therefore Chriſt choſe him a place to teach and baptiſe in vpon the riuer of Iordan, neere <hi>Iohn,</hi> that they might meet and conuerſe together. A little after, the queſtion was moued concerning Purification, and <hi>Iohn</hi> began to preach of Chriſt, and that he was the Son of God, and Spouſe of the Church. In this Sermon
<hi>Iohn</hi> in many places called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the Friend of the Spouſe. From whence it is euident, That Chriſt and <hi>Iohn</hi> in the moneth of Nouember did often meet and conuerſe together.</p>
               <p>In the moneth of December Chriſt being aſſured of the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. and of the perſecution and fallacies of the Phariſees, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. went from Iordan, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into Galilee by the prouince and countrey of Samaria: in which countrey he came to <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well, which ſtood cloſe by Sichar, in former times called Sichem, about ſome 10 miles from Iordan towards the Weſt; in which place he ſpake with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan woman (this happened ſome foure months before Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt) and after went into Sichar, and continued there for the ſpace of two dayes; and after returning into Galile, was very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably

               <p>When he had trauelled from Sichar to Cana (a city in Galile the lower, which was 32 miles, where he had changed water into wine) there was a certain Ruler came vnto him, whoſe ſonne lay ſicke at Capernaum, 20 miles diſtant, and beſought him to heale his ſon; our Sauiour told him that his ſon was made whole: ſo he beleeued, and his ſon was made whole the ſame houre.

But the great men that were inhabitants of this City had more reſpect to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat profit, than to the doctrine &amp; miracles that Chriſt wrought among them; from whence it came to paſſe that they did as it were neglect and contemne that good which God had offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: which made our Sauior ſay, <hi>And thou Capernaum, which ſeemeſt to be exalted vp vnto heauen, ſhalt be caſt down into hell: for if the miracles had been done in Sodom and Gomorah, which haue been done in thee, they had continued vntill this day.

For there was no ſuch benefit offered to any Citie, neither ſuch honours and dignities, as were to Capernaum, our Sauior himſelfe dwelling there. Wherefore for their ingratitude and impiety the city hath diuers times bin waſted and deſtroied, as well by the Romanes as other nations; ſo that at this day this glorious city is become ſo deſolate, that there is ſcarce 8 houſes ſtanding, and they alſo like ſmall ſheds.</p>

                  <hi>The Trauels of our Sauiour Chriſt in the ſecond yeare</hi> of his Ministerie; which was the two and thirtieth yeare of his age.</head>
               <p>IN the moneth of Ianuary, Chriſt went from Cana in Galile to Nazareth, which was eight miles. Here, vpon the Sabboth day he went into the Sinagogue and began to teach, inſomuch as the inhabitants were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine: but the citizens being ingratefull, he went to Capernaum, a citie which he had choſen to dwell in before all others, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 4. which was 12 miles, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>In the moneth of February hee compaſſed about all Galile, preaching the Goſpel of the kingdome of God, healing the ſick, and thoſe that were diſeaſed amongſt the people,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 4. In this viſitation our Sauiour went to Gaeſarea Philippi, which was diſtant from Capernaum fortie eight miles towards the North. Here <hi>Matthew</hi> was called, as he was at the receipt of Cuſtome;
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:7153:224"/> and the woman was healed of her bloudy iſſue, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. But that
<hi>Mathew</hi> was called about this time, the circumſtances of times make euident; for a little after the ſecond Paſſeouer of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Chriſt, the ſame <hi>Mathew</hi> was choſen to be an Apoſtle, <hi>Luke,</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. <hi>Mark</hi> 2. In the moneth of March, the inhabitants of the towns which Chriſt viſited in Galilee, brought vnto him many that were poſſeſſed of diuels, and afflicted with other diſeaſes, all which he healed: inſomuch that there followed him a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany out of Galile and Decapolis, and from Ieruſalem and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea, and of all the countries beyond Iordan, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. Thus hauing finiſhing this viſitation, as it may be thought, he returned backe againe to Capernaum, where he dwelt, as I haue ſhewed before, which was 48 miles; for Caeſarea Philippi ſtood ſo farre from Capernaum.</p>
               <p>A little after theſe things were finiſhed,<note place="margin">The ſecond Paſſeouer of the Miniſterie of Chriſt:</note> was the feaſt of the Iewes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. and Ieſus went vp to Ieruſalem, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. to celebrate the feaſt of the Paſſeouer, which this yeare hapned a little before Harueſt, which was 56 miles. This ſecond Paſſeouer of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie of Chriſt fell vpon the ſix and twentieth day of March, at which time Chriſt celebrated the Paſſeouer with his Diſciples according to the Law of God. Here, vpon the Sabboth day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt day of March, he healed a certaine man that lay by the Poole Betheſda, which had bin diſeaſed eight and thirtie yeres, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. And at the end of the Paſſeouer he went with his Diſciples from Ieruſalem, through the corne fields: but his Diſciples being hungry began to pull the eares of corne, and to eat them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Phariſes beeing offended at them, began to reprehend our Sauiour Chriſt and his Diſciples: vpon which followed the diſputation concerning the Sabboth, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. <hi>Matth.</hi>
12.</p>
               <p>Vpon the ſeuenth day of Aprill he went on the Sabboth day to Peraea, which country was in the command of <hi>Herod Antipas,</hi> and there he healed a man with a dried hand, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.
<hi>Marke</hi> 3. The country of Peraea beyond Iordan is diſtant from Ieruſalem twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie miles.</p>
               <p>But when the Herodian Councell heard that he had healed a man on the Sabboth day, they ſought occaſion how they might doe to put him to death: Wherefore our Sauiour Chriſt went
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:7153:225"/> thence to the ſea of Galile, which was 40 miles. Here he went vp into a mountain not far from Capernaum, and choſe the twelue Apoſtles, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. <hi>Mark</hi>
3. And then vpon this mountain he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto the people, which reſorted thither vnto him out of the Countrey round about, whom they heard with great diligence and attendance. This ſermon being ended, hee came down from the mountaine, and healed the man that was ſicke of the Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Hee alſo went into Capernaum and healed the Centurions ſeruant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.
<hi>Luke</hi> 7. Afterward Chriſt in the ſame moneth of April, when the man whom he healed of his leproſie had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed that Miracle, hee went from Capernaum into the Deſart which lay neere vnto Bethſaida; for there was a certaine Deſart, <hi>Marke</hi> 1. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. In the moneth of May our Sauiour went out of Galile towards Ieruſalem, to keep the feaſt of Penticoſt; ſo he came to the gates of the city Naim, which ſtood on the border of Samaria, and was diſtant from Capernaum 16 miles. Here he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called the widowes ſonne to life,
<hi>Luke</hi> 7. And after he went to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, which was 48 miles, that he might celebrate the feaſt of Penticoſt, according to the law of God, <hi>Exo.</hi> 23. <hi>Thrice euery yeare ſhall euery male childe appeare before the Lord thy God.</hi> This feaſt fell this yeare vpon the 15 day of May; for it behooued our Sauiour, according to the law, to go euery yere to Ieruſalem to theſe three principall feaſts, that is, of the Paſſeouer, Penticoſt, and of the Tabernacles. A little after the feaſt of Penticoſt, <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in priſon) hauing certaine intelligence of the Miracle that our Sauiour wrought vpon the Widowes ſonne at the gates of Naim; and of other wonderfull Miracles that he did in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and in other places in Iudaea; ſent two of his diſciples from the Caſtle of Macharuntes, to aske him the queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was the Meſſia or no? So when they came vnto him and deliuered their meſſage, at that time he cured many of their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and plagues, and euill ſpirits, and to many blinde men hee gaue ſight freely. And Ieſus ſaid vnto them, <hi>Goe your wayes and tell</hi> Iohn <hi>what things you haue ſeene and heard, That the Blinde ſee, the Halt go, the Lepers are clenſed, the Deafe heare, the Dead are raiſed, and the Poore receiue the Goſpell: And bleſſed is hee that ſhall not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in me, Mathew</hi> 11.
<hi>Luke</hi> 7. At this ſermon it was thought hee
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:7153:225"/> conuerted the ſinner that waſhed his feet, &amp; poured a box of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious oile vpon his head, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>In the moneth of Iune our Sauior Ieſus Chriſt went with the Twelue about ſix and fifty miles out of Iudaea into Galilee, and there in diuers Cities and Townes he began to preach and teach the Kingdome of God. At this time there were diuers Women followed him, whom hee had healed of euill Spirits, and of their infirmities; but principally <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom he had caſt ſeuen Diuels; and <hi>Ioan</hi> the wife of <hi>Chuza, Herods</hi> Procurator; and
<hi>Suſanna:</hi> All which miniſtred vnto him of their ſubſtance, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Now when he had trauelled from place to place ſome certain time, and viſited many cities and towns thereabouts, he returned backe again to the city of Capernaum, where it is ſaid that our Sauior Chriſt dwelt; and there diſpoſſeſt the man of a diuel, that was both blind, lame, and dumbe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. And going thence to the ſea he recited 8 Parables, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>Marke</hi> 4. <hi>Luke</hi> 8. In the euening of the ſame day he went ſix miles into the country of the Gadarens, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4. <hi>Luke</hi> 8. The next day betimes in the morning he went out of the ſhip into the countrey of the Gadarens, and healed two that were poſſeſſed of diuels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Out of theſe two he caſt a legion of Diuels, and ſuffered them to enter into the herd of ſwine, which they caried headlong into the ſea. Preſently our Sauiour Chriſt went thence 6 miles, into the land of Geneſareth, where there was a great multitude vpon the ſea ſhore not far from the City of Capernaum, that expected his comming, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 8. Within a few daies after, about the beginning of Iune, hee entred into Capernaum, and there healed the man that lay ſick vpon his bed of a dead palſie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 5. after he went to ſea, and taught the multitude that came to him, <hi>Mar</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>From Capernaum hee went to Caeſarea Philippi, 48 miles, where being inuited to a banquet by
<hi>Mathew,</hi> he ate among Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and ſinners, and confuted the Phariſees and
<hi>Iohns</hi> diſciples. In the ſame city he reſtored the daughter of <hi>Iairus</hi> to life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. <hi>Marke</hi> 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 5. and as hee went thence, hee reſtored two men
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:7153:226"/> to their ſight, and caſt out a Diuell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>About the end of the moneth of Iuly our Sauior Chriſt went from Ceſarea Philippi to Nazareth, 36 miles; where becauſe of the ingratitude and contempt of the citiſens he did no great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>In the moneth of Auguſt our Sauior Chriſt went from Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth toward Ieruſalem to the feaſt of Tabernacles, and as he went viſited the towns and cities neere adioyning. Now when he ſaw that they wanted Teachers, it beeing at this time the ſecond har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, <hi>Loe the Harueſt is great, but the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers are few, &amp;c.</hi> and he ſent his Diſciples out into the Harueſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Of this ſecond harueſt you may reade, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. where God commanded the people that they ſhould obſerue the feaſt of the Tabernacles, when in the end of the yere they had gathered in all the fruits of the fields. Alſo in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. it is thus written,
<hi>From the fifteenth day of the ſeuenteenth moneth, when you haue gathered all the fruits of your land, you ſhall celebrate vnto the Lord your God ſeuen dayes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From Galile our Sauior Chriſt came to Ieruſalem, 64 miles; where from the 20 to the 27 day of September he celebrated the feaſt of Tabernacles, according to the Law of God.</p>

               <p>From thence he went to Ieruſalem, which was 56 miles, to the feaſt of the Paſſeouer, being the third Paſſeouer of his miniſterie.</p>

               <p>But our Sauiour hauing a determination to depart from this place, this woman was very importunate that hee would diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe her daughter of a diuell; which (becauſe of her importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) he did, <hi>Mat</hi> 15.

               <p>Afterward in the ſame moneth of May he went into a ſhip and paſſed thence into the parts of Dalmatia, and vpon the borders of Magdala, which was foure miles, hee propounded the ſigne of the Prophet <hi>Ionah</hi> to the Phariſes and Sadduces, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.</p>

               <p>About the end of the moneth of May Chriſt went to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which was 56 miles, where vpon the ſecond day of Iune he kept the feaſt of Penticoſt, according as God had commanded,

               <p>In the ſame moneth of Iune he went the ſecond time vnto the borders of the Gentiles, where
<hi>Peter</hi> in the name of all the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples vpon the confines of Caeſarea Philippi, made that notable confeſſion, ſaying, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God, Luk.</hi> 9. Capernaum is diſtant from Caeſarea Philippi 48 miles.</p>
               <p>Six, or (as <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith) eight daies after, our Sauiour in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of Iune went to the mountain Thabor, which ſtood 48 miles from Caeſarea Philippi towards the Southweſt, where hee was transfigured; and the next day after he cured the Lunaticke, and caſt out a Diuell,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Marke</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In the month of Iuly Chriſt walked into Galile, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his doctrine with many wonderfull miracles, which did greatly amaſe his Diſciples, where hee put them in minde of the croſſe and of his death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>From thence he returned to Capernaum, which was 10 miles from Mount Thabor: at this time
<hi>Peter</hi> went to the Lake of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſereth, &amp; there caught a fiſh, in whoſe mouth he found a Stater, which was worth ij. s. vi. d. in our money, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.

<hi>Marke. Luke</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In the moneth of Auguſt he had a full determination to make a journey through Samaria into Iudaea, and ſo by little and little (viſiting the Churches as he went) to go to Ieruſalem to the feaſt of the Tabernacles, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. but when he came to Samaria, which was ten miles from Capernaum, the Samaritans would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:7153:230"/> him, becauſe he made as though he would go to Ieruſalem; wherefore he turned aſide into Galile, <hi>Luc.</hi> 9. And as he was there viſiting the Churches, there came a certaine man vnto him ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I will follow thee whither ſoeuer thou goeſt.</hi> But Chriſt anſwered him ſaying, <hi>The Foxes haue holes, and the fowles of the heauens haue neſts, but the Sonne of man hath not where to hide his head, Matth.</hi> 8. And to another Ieſus ſaid, <hi>Follow thou me.</hi> But he anſwered, <hi>Let me firſt goe and bury my father.</hi> There was another alſo that would haue followed Chriſt, but he would firſt goe take his leaue of his friends, <hi>Luc.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In the month of September, about the time of the ſecond har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, which was next before the feaſt of the Tabernacles, <hi>Leu.</hi> 23. Chriſt began his laſt viſitation throughout all the land of Iudea; at which time he ſent forth ſeuentie of his diſciples into Galile, to prepare the way, and ſo Diſperſed labourers into his harueſt; ſaying, <hi>The harueſt is great, but the labourers are few, Luc.</hi> 10. This ſpeech ſeems to be taken from the preſent condition of the time for it was now herueſt time, it being a little before the vernall Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of October, when the feaſt of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles drew neere, the Diſciples and thoſe that were of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of our Sauiour according to the fleſh, went vp to the Feaſt, but he remained in Galile, notwithſtanding a little after he went priuily vp: now betweene Galile and Ieruſalem were accounted 56 miles, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. Vpon the ninth day of October was this feaſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in Ieruſalem; and being now half paſt, our Sauior Chriſt taught publiquely in the Temple, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. Vpon the fifteenth day of October (it being the laſt day of the Feaſt of the Tabernacles, and the Sabboth day, he taught the ſecond time publiquely in the Temple, and ſo continued preaching and doing miracles in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem vntill the Feaſt of the Dedication, which was kept about the middle of Winter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>In the Month of Nouember he preached daily in the temple, and at night went to the Mount of Oliues, where he reſted, which was aboue halfe a mile from Ieruſalem, and euery morning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe to the Temple. At this time there came vnto him certaine Scribes and Pharaſes, who brought a woman which had
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:7153:230"/> beene lately taken in adultery, and ſaid vnto him, <hi>Maſter, what ſhall we do with this woman, &amp;c.</hi> And hee anſwered, <hi>He among you that is without ſinne throw the firſt ſtone at her, Iohn</hi> 8. About this time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were the Sermons concerning the power of the Son of God, and a great diſputation between our Sauior and the Iewes,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. for which cauſe they would haue ſtoned him. In the Moneth of December Chriſt wintred in Ieruſalem, and recited the parable of the Sheepe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. Alſo vpon the Sabboth day a little before the feaſt of the Dedication, he healed a man that was born blind,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>In this feaſt the Iewes (being angry becauſe he had healed the blind man vpon the Sabboth day) compaſſed our Sauiour about as he was in <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch; and when they heard our Sauiour confeſſe openly, that hee was the Sonne of God, they began to grow into a fury, and for very anger would haue ſtoned him to death. Wherefore our Sauiour Chriſt went thence beyond Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, and continued there the reſt of the Winter, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. But before hee went to Ieruſalem there were returned vnto him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the ſeuentie Diſciples, which a little before (in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of September) he had ſent abroad, and there at that time he recited the ſimilitude of the man, who deſcending from Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem to Iericho, fell amongſt theeues. This ſimilitude ſeemeth to be taken from the preſent occaſion, becauſe our Sauior Chriſt going from Ieruſalem beyond Iordan, was to paſſe through great wilderneſſes juſt in the way as they goe thence to Iericho, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time he went from Ieruſalem to Bethania, which was almoſt two miles, and there viſited <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> where <hi>Martha</hi> miniſtred vnto him, but
<hi>Mary</hi> ſitting at his feet gaue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heed to his Doctrine, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>At this time he tooke his leaue of theſe two ſiſters, and went thence to Bethabara beyond Iordan, where <hi>Iohn</hi> baptiſed, which was 16 miles, it being now about the midſt of Winter, Chriſt at this time being about 33 yeares of age.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that there were many which refer that long journey of our Sauiour Chriſt when hee went to viſit all Iudaea, the ſending forth of his Diſciples, &amp; diuers other miracles men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:7153:231"/> from the ninth chapter of <hi>Luke</hi> to the ſixteenth, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the following yere. But I am of opinion that all thoſe things could not haue beene done within the compaſſe of foure moneths, and before the feaſt of the Dedication: ſo that it muſt needs bee that the ſeuentie Diſciples were ſent forth before the feaſt of the Dedication; for after the feaſt of the Dedication (which was celebrated in the midſt of Winter,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 10.) there were but two moneths betweene it and the raiſing vp of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> in which ſhort time all thoſe things which are deſcribed by <hi>Luke,</hi> could not poſſibly be accompliſhed, eſpecially conſidering that our Sauiour Chriſt wintered ſome time in Bethabara, and there taught the multitude that came vnto him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. So theſe trauels of our Sauiour were 596 miles, or thereabouts, beſides the diuers viſitations and journeies hee went hither and thither: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great multitude of them, it was not poſſible for the Euangeliſt to ſet them downe.</p>

But when he came within view of the city, ſo that the citiſens from the wall might diſcern the ſhips, he left the body of the nauie a good way remote from Tiberias, and tooke only one ſhip manned with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen men, and went cloſe to the citie of Tiberias, as it ſeemed to haue had a parley with the citiſens: but they ſeeing ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſhips, and the bold reſolution of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> ſuppoſing that they had beene ſufficiently manned, and contained a great armie, were greatly affraid, inſomuch that they caſt away their armes, and came out of the citie with humble petitions to

                  <p>THis was the chiefe citie of Phoenicia, diſtant from Ieruſalem 100 miles towards the North. It was firſt builded by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſens of Zidon, (becauſe of a ſedition that hapned in that Citie) 240 yeares before the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, juſt in the place where at this day the ruins of antient Tyre are to be ſeene. But after it began to grow famous (which was about ſuch tims as Troy was deſtroled) King <hi>Angenor</hi> remoued it to a rocke which ſtood in the heart of the Mediterranean ſea, compaſſed about therewith like an Iſland, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26. and beſtowed great coſt in fortifying and building it.

It
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:7153:233"/> was but a ſmall towne, almoſt three miles about, and two miles wide: yet the great Mart Towne in thoſe parts, for Merchants reſorted thither from all the three parts of the World (Europe, Aſia, and Africa) as well for the vttering as buying commodities; and was made ſo much the more famous, becauſe of the ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſtrength: It ſtood diſtant from the land of Phoenicia al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two miles; vpon which continent they had obtained a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of land for the maintenance of the citie, containing 19000 paces in compaſſe. The citizens alſo being greatly inriched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their trafficke, built vp many faire cities and townes in more remote parts, which was added to their juriſdiction, as Leptis, Vtica, rnd Carthage, ſcituated in Africa.

But becauſe of their extreame arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie and pride, it was twice conquered and ruinated: Firſt by

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the occaſion that <hi>Alexander</hi> made warre vpon this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, was becauſe the citizens vpon a time ſending vnto him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Embaſſadors with a crowne of gold, in token of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to congratulate his proſperitie (which he accepted ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kindely, and gaue them royall entertainment, as to his friends) amongſt other things, hee told them that hee would come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Citie, and doe ſacrifice to their god <hi>Hercules</hi> (for the kings of the Macedonians are perſwaded that they proceed from the off-ſpring of that god, and beſide hee was commanded by an Oracle ſo to do.) But the Embaſſadors of Tyre anſwered, that the Temple of <hi>Hercules</hi> ſtood without the citie in Paaetzron, where ancient Tyre ſtood; ſo that the King might eaſily come thither
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:7153:234"/> to doe ſacrifice; but <hi>Alexander</hi> hearing theſe words, could not containe himſelfe, but in a great anger anſwered, And doe yee proud Citizens put ſuch truſt in the ſtrength and ſcituation of your Citie, that you thinke I am not able to come to it with my Army by land? You ſhall well perceiue within this ſhort ſpace, that you are ſcituated vpon the continent, and that I will enter it and ſacke it. With theſe terrible words the Embaſſadors depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſhortly after <hi>Alexander</hi> followed them with a great and mightie army.</p>
                  <p>But when it was knowne that <hi>Alexander</hi> had vndertaken the ſacking of this citie, there were many that thought it almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to accompliſh his deſignes; firſt, becauſe of the inconſtancie of the windes, and the vehemencie of the water, whereby all ſuch matter as they caſt into the ſea to joine it to the continent, would be driuen away by the violence of the Water; againe, the city was compaſſed about with ſuch exceeding high walls, and fortified with ſuch ſtrong towers, that it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to bring any engines to batter them, or faſten any ſcaling ladders to aſcend them, vnleſſe it were by ſhips. Twice <hi>Alexander</hi> attempted by flinging into the ſea mighty trees of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus, and heapes of the ruines of ancient Tyre to haue made a bridge to it, or elſe joyne it to the continent, inſomuch as the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians mocked the Macedonians; ſaying, <hi>What, can your king</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander <hi>conquer</hi> Neptune <hi>the God of the ſea?</hi> For the violence of the ſea was ſo extreame, that it carried away all things with it, and oftentimes broke the ſhips that were joyned together to make a bridge, and drowned the ſoldiers that beſieged and ſought againſt the citie. During this ſiege, a Citiſen of Tyrus dreamt that their Idoll
<hi>Apollo</hi> would depart from them; whereupon they bound the Image of <hi>Apollo</hi> with a chaine of gold, vnto the pillar where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſtood, that he might not leaue them. There hapned alſo a horrible oſtent amongſt the Macedonians; for a certaine ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er breaking bread, there fell from it ſome few drops of bloud; at the hearing of which accident <hi>Alexander</hi> was greatly amaſed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee was reſolued by one <hi>Ariſtander</hi> a very skilfull Prophet, That if it iſſued from off the outſide of the bread, it had betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a heauie euent to the Macedoniaes; but in regard that it iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:7153:234"/> from the inſide of the bread, it foreſhewed that hee ſhould forthwith conquer the towne hee had ſo long beſieged: And ſo it hapned; for when <hi>Alexander</hi> had beſieged the city for the ſpace of ſeuen moneths, with great difficulty he woon it: but before he could win it he was conſtrained to vſe a great multitude of ſhips and faſten them together with yron bands, vpon which placing many engines of battery and other offenſiue inſtruments, what with the moouing of the ſhips and the extreame violence of the batterie, they ouercame the citie. This exploit <hi>Alexander</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed when he was 25 yeares of age, and about 300 yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>There was one thing that <hi>Alexander</hi> did during his ſiege, that was memorable; for before any of his ſouldiers would attempt to aſcend the walls, hee went in perſon with his crowne vpon his head, and in princely armor, and ſcaled a high tower of the citie, where he expreſt an extraordinary reſolution, and by reaſon of his courage did great hurt to the enemy, who perceiuing him to be the King, reſorted to that place in great heaps, and ſhot at him with all their might; but hee manfully defended himſelfe, and compelled the enemy to fly. In this aſſault there were 6000 of the inhabitants ſlaine; and after he had entred the wals and ſackt the citie, he cauſed 2000 to be tyed to croſſes and throwne into the ſea. From whence may be gathered, that God by this young Prince did accompliſh this great worke, that the prophecies of the Prophets, <hi>Eſay</hi> 23. <hi>Ieremy</hi> 43. and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 25.26. might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
                  <p>Afterward <hi>Alexander</hi> (as <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> obſerueth) cauſed the ſea to be filled vp, that it might be no more an Iſland, and joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it to the continent; vpon which place he cauſed Tyrus to be rebuilded, and compaſſed it about with a wall fiue and twentie foot thicke, ſtrengthned with twelue towers, that it might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently fortified to oppoſe the incurſion of any enemy; ſo that it continued ſafe a long time after, and in the time of our Sauiour Chriſt was a faire city, though it neuer attaind to the former dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and power that it had before <hi>Alexander</hi> conquered it. The ancient citie of Tyre was diſtant from this city about foure miles towards the South.</p>

In the time of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> the Emperour, there were many Martyrs put to death in this Citie: And at this time it is called by the name of <hi>El porta del zur,</hi> that is, <hi>the hauen of Zur;</hi> as it was in the Old Teſtament called by the name of Zor. In the yeare 1100, when the holy land was in the hands of the Chriſtians, there was an Archbiſhop of Tyre, vnder whoſe gouerment were the Biſhops of Ptolomais, Sydon, and Beryti, &amp;c.

                  <p>This towne in times paſt was one of the chiefe cities of Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia, but becauſe of the extraordinarie pride of the citiſens, God afflicted them with diuers puniſhments, &amp; brought in <hi>Ocho</hi> king of the Perſians, who beſieged it, and by treaſon woon it and burnt it to the ground, as <hi>Diodorus Siculus lib.</hi> 16. ſaith. The Citiſens whereof were driuen to ſuch ſtreights by the enemy, that there periſhed in the fire aboue fortie thouſand men. Within a while after <hi>Darius</hi> laſt Emperour of the Perſians rebuilt it, but made it nothing ſo beautifull, neither fortified it in like manner as it was before: hee ordained one
<hi>Strato</hi> to be King thereof, a man proud and arrogant. After, about three hundred and two yeares before the natiuitie of Chriſt, <hi>Alexander</hi> being then but 24 yeres of age, hauing ouercome <hi>Darius</hi> that mighty Emperour of the Perſians, at Iſſa a citie of Cilicia, in a cruell and ſharpe warre; he ſent <hi>Hepheſtion</hi> one of his Princes, to the Sydonians, with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to depoſe <hi>Strato,</hi> and to let the Citiſens vnderſtand that they ſhould chuſe him for their King, whom they thought moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that honour, as <hi>Quint.

At this time there was a certaine young man among the followers of <hi>Hephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi> in whoſe behalfe he moued the Citiſens that hee might be their King; but they refuſed, ſaying, it was not their cuſtome to chuſe any to rule ouer them, but ſuch as were of the Kings ſtocke and progenie. <hi>Hepheſtion</hi> hearing this anſwer, greatly admired their reſolution and modeſtie, eſpecially when they refuſed to accept him for their King, whom others had ſought to obtaine with fire and ſword; ſaying, Truly there is more required to rule and gouerne a Kingdome, than to get it; but yet name one vnto me of royall diſcent, whom you would willingly receiue to
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:7153:236"/> be your King. So they named vnto him one <hi>Abdolomius,</hi> who had beene knowne to haue beene of the Kings ſtocke, by many diſcents; but becauſe of his pouertie he was conſtrained to dwell in the ſuburbs of the Citie in a cottage, and had little elſe but a Garden to liue vpon. This man howſoeuer poore, and becauſe of that, of many contemned; yet hee was knowne to be honeſt and of an vpright life, following with all dilligence his vocation, without any regard of other buſineſſe; inſomuch as he was vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant of all theſe ſtirre and combuſtions which had ſo lately vexed Aſia. As he was now in his garden digging and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, purging it of weeds, and planting herbes; <hi>Hepheſtion</hi> with the reſt of the Citizens went vnto him, and brought him the robes and habiliments of a King. The poore Gardner ſtood ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſee ſuch a company of gallants come vnto him: but <hi>Hephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> told him, That the occaſion of their comming was to make an exchange with him of thoſe royall ornaments which he had in his hands, for thoſe poore and foule garments which he wore; therefore goe and waſh thy ſelfe and returne.

<pb n="465" facs="tcp:7153:236"/> not perceiue it any whit repugnant to the fame of his birth, hee demanded of him how it was poſſible that hee ſhould endure his pouertie with patience. To which he anſwered, I pray the gods I may continue the gouernment of this kingdome with the like minde; for theſe hands were ſufficient for me to liue by, and as I had nothing, ſo I wanted nothing. At which anſwer <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſo well pleaſed, that he not only gaue him all the princely jewels and ornaments of the firſt king called <hi>Strato,</hi> but alſo a great part of the booty which he tooke from the Emperor of Perſia, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his command all the neighboring countries round about. This hiſtory I haue inſerted, that thereby we might perceiue the mighty power of God in all his works; that can exalt the poore, contented with his eſtate, out of the very duſt, and can pull the mighty from their thrones. So the Euill carke and care in this world to gather riches for the Vertuous to inherit. But to return to Sidon: This city did ſo much increaſe, and grew ſo famous in ſucceeding ages, that it was the chiefe town (Tyrus onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) in all Phoenicia, ioyning vpon the Weſt to the Mediterrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſea, extending it ſelfe towards the North and South, lying in a plain vnder Antilibanus, which mountain lay ſome two miles off it vpon the Eaſt.

Theſe two caſtles with the whole city in times paſt were in the hands of the Knights templers.

There is alſo found great aboundance of Grapes which are very delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pleaſant to the taſt, wherof the wine Canamella is made. But becauſe the Turkes and Saracens are inhibited by the ſtrict law of their Alcaron from drinking of wine, therefore they ſuffer no vineyards to be planted, neither the inhabitants to dreſſe thoſe Vines that grow naturally. Before the Eaſt gate of the antient city which now lies deſtroied, there is built a Chappel, in which place they ſay the woman of Canaan entreated our Sauior Chriſt to caſt a Diuell out of her daughter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.

               <p>Vpon the 30 day of March hee went from Bethania to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem betimes in the morning; in which journy he curſed the Fig-tree that wanted fruit, and after entring into the city, hee caſt out of the Temple the mony-changers and Merchants, <hi>Mark</hi> 11. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the euening (as may be gathered by circumſtance of time) he returned back again to Bethania. This daies journy was foure miles.</p>
               <p>Vpon the laſt day of March in the morning Chriſt went back againe from Bethania to Ieruſalem; and by the way as hee went, his Diſciples beheld the Figge tree that he had curſed, and loe it it was dried vp, <hi>Mar.</hi> 11. After, when he was in the Temple, there came certaine Phariſees vnto him and diſputed with him. At which time he recited the Parable of the mariage of the Kings daughter. Alſo certaine Scribes and Phariſees came vnto him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him whether it was lawfull to pay tribute vnto <hi>Caeſar, Matth.</hi> 21.22. He alſo ſharply rebuked the Scribes and Phariſees, and
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:7153:241"/> recited the Simile of the Hen and her Chickens, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. After that, he went to the mount of Olives, almoſt a mile. And then his Diſciples looking vpon the goodly building of the temple, from thence he tooke occaſion to preach of the deſtruction of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, &amp; the conſummation of the world; ſo he ſtayd al that night in the mount of Oliues, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>Vpon the firſt day of Aprill being Wedneſday, our Sauiour Chriſt riſing before day, taught again in the Temple; and after as he was going to Bethania, he ſaid to his Diſciples,
<hi>Know yee that within theſe two daies is the feaſt of the Paſſouer, and the Son of man ſhall be deliuered tnto the hands of ſinners, and crucified.</hi> At the ſame time the chiefe Prieſts aſſembled themſelues together, and took coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell how they might do to take him by deceit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. The ſame day as our Sauiour Chriſt was in the houſe of

Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Chriſt</note>Vpon Turſeday being the ſecond day of Aprill, the dayes of the feaſt of the Paſſeouer being now at hand, Chriſt with his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples prepared for the eating of the Paſchal Lambe; which was the fourth Paſſeouer of our Sauiour, and when about the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this day it was neceſſarie for them to keepe the Paſchall Lambe, and to prepare the Paſſeouer according to Gods Law; Chriſt ſent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to make ready the Supper, and he with the reſt of his Diſciples about euening went from Bethania to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ieruſalem, iuſt at the beginning of the 14 day of the 1 mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Abib or Niſan, which began about the euening of this day. Here he celebrated his laſt ſupper among his Diſciples, between ſix and ſeuen of the clock in the euening; at which time he cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper, concerning the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of his body and bloud: of which you may read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.
<hi>Luke</hi> 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Afterward about the eight houre he waſhed his Diſciples feet, and then leaning vpon the table, hee pointed out <hi>Iudas</hi> that ſhould betray him,
<hi>Iohn ca.</hi> 13. From the ninth houre to the tenth houre, about the ſecond Watch of the night, <hi>Iudas</hi> that Traitor went from his Diſciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. In the
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:7153:241"/> mean time Chriſt made that long ſermon recited onely by <hi>Iohn,</hi>
14.15.16. and made that effectual prayer, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. About the 10 houre (after they had ſung a Pſalme) Chriſt went ouer the brooke Cedron, to the garden of Gethſamene, being ſomwhat more than halfe a mile. There between the hours of 11 and 12, he ſweat wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and bloud, and prayed earneſtly. About 12 of the clock, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then midnight, Chriſt was betraied by <hi>Iudas,</hi> who about three daies before had ſold him for thirty ſiluerlings, which was worth about 3 li. 15 s.</p>
               <p>From Gethſamene the Iews brought him bound to Ieruſalem being more than halfe a mile: and about one of the clocke in the morning caried him to the houſe of <hi>Annas</hi> who was one of the chiefe prieſts. About two of the clock they led him from thence to <hi>Caiaphas</hi> chiefe Prieſt. From three of the clock till 4, (which was about cocks crowing) <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt. At the ſame time <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and all the Prieſts of Ieruſalem would haue condemned the Lord of Glory the ſon of God. At the ſame time alſo the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and Officers of the Prieſts beat him and mocked him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fiue of the clock in the morning Chriſt was condemned by the whole conſent of the Synedrion of the Iewes, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. All theſe things Chriſt ſuffered between Thurſday and Friday. And whereas the Iewes according to the commandement of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their day in the euening, therefore that night wherin our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt ſuffered all theſe things, belonged vnto the 14 day of the moneth Abib. So that iuſt at the ſame time as the Feaſt of the Paſchal Lambe was celebrated amongſt the Iewes, Chriſt the true Lambe of God was made a liuing ſacrifice on the Croſſe for the ſinnes of man. Thus as we haue obſerued the houres of the night, ſo likewiſe let vs obſerue the houres of the day.</p>
               <p>Friday being the third day of Aprill (which as I haue ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the euening before) was the fourteenth day of the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Abib or Niſan among the Iewes. At ſix of the clock in the morning, about Sunne riſing of the ſame day, our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt was brought vnto
<hi>Pilat,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> Iſcariot hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, becauſe he had betrayed the innocent bloud. About ſeuen
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:7153:242"/> of the clock in the ſame morning our Sauior Chriſt was carried to
<hi>Herod Antipas,</hi> that cruell Tyrant who the yeare before had put <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> to death: here he was daiſdainfully handled. At 8 of the clocke our Sauior Chriſt returned to
<hi>Pilat,</hi> who propounded vnto the Iewes (becauſe they were to haue a capital offender deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto them at the feaſt of the Paſſouer) whether they would haue Ieſus their King, or <hi>Barabas</hi> who had beene a murtherer, let looſe vnto them? But they condemned Ieſus and choſe <hi>Barabas,</hi> which name ſignifies, The ſonne of the multitude, or a ſeditious man. About 9 of the clock in the morning (which the Iews com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the third houre of the day, becauſe it ſucceeded the morning, and continued till noon) our Sauiour Chriſt was whipt and crowned with thornes. About ten of the clock <hi>Pontius Pilat,</hi> in the place called Gabbatha publikely condemned Chriſt to be crucified, and waſhed his hands in token of innocencie. <hi>Pontius</hi> ſignifies cruell and inhumane; <hi>Pilat,</hi> a man armed with a Roman dart, <hi>Mart. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. Between ten and 11, our Savior Chriſt carying his croſſe, was brought to the place called Golgotha. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 11 of the clock (the third houre of the morning beeing not yet fully finiſhed) our Sauior Chriſt was faſtned vpon the croſſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. He therefore hung 4 hours vpon the croſſe, that is, from about 11 of the clocke, till about three in the afternoon. And he ſpake before that ſupernatural Eclipſe of the Sun three memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſayings: Firſt, <hi>Father forgiue them, for they know not what they doe, Luke</hi> 19. Secondly he ſaid to his mother, <hi>Woman behold thy Sonne:</hi> And to <hi>Iohn</hi> being conuerted, <hi>Behold thy mother.</hi> Thirdly, to the Theefe,
<hi>Verily I ſay vnto thee, this day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> About twelue of the clock (in that meridian which the Iewes call the ſixt houre, that is, the ſixt houre from the riſing of the Sunne) that ſupernatural Eclipſe of the Sunne happened, of which you may reade in <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Areopagite, and <hi>Euſebius.</hi> About three of the clock in the afternoone, which the Iewes call the ninth houre (the Sunne now beginning to receiue his light) our Sauiour Chriſt ſpake theſe foure ſayings, <hi>My God, my God why haſt thou forſaken me? Matth.</hi> 27. <hi>I thirſt, Ioh.</hi> 19. When he
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:7153:242"/> had taken the Sponge he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed, Ioh.</hi> 19. And after, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with a loud voice he ſaid, <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my ſpirit,</hi> and ſo died. At which time there were many wonderfull miracles wrought, as you may read <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. <hi>Mark</hi> 15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. About foure of clock in the afternoone our bleſſed Sauiour was pierced through with a Lance, and there iſſued out of his ſide bloud and water, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. About fiue of the clock, which the Iews call the eleuenth houre of the day, our Sauior Chriſt was buried by <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of Arimathea and
<hi>Nicodemus.</hi> About the ſixt houre there fell an eclipſe of the Moone, which was naturall and not miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, neither is it obſerued by any of the Euangeliſts.</p>
               <p>Vpon the fifteenth day of the firſt month, which anſwereth to the 4 of Aprill (beeing iuſtly called the great and holy Sabbath of the Iewes, for that Chriſt this day reſted in the Sepulchre) the Prieſts &amp; Phariſees being partly ioyful becauſe, as they thought, the diſturber of the common peace &amp; one that oppoſed their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was dead; and partly carefull how they might preuent his reſurrection, went to <hi>Pilat,</hi> and obtained of him a band of ſoldiers to watch the ſepulchre, and to put his ſeale vpon the ſtone.</p>
               <p>Vpon the fift day of Aprill early in the morning, our Sauiour Chriſt hauing ouercome death and the diuel, by his diuine power raiſed him ſelf vp from the dead, according as he had foretold his diſciples, and appeared to <hi>Mary Magdalen, Ioh.</hi> 20. and to other women that touched his feet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. About noone he appeared to <hi>Simon Peter, Luk.</hi> 24. 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15. In the afternoone hee trauelled with two of his diſciples almoſt 8 miles, to the caſtle of Emaus, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. One of theſe diſciples was <hi>Cleopas</hi> the brother of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who brought vp our Sauiour Chriſt. The other, as may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the circumſtance of the ſtory, was <hi>Luke,</hi> becauſe hee hath ſet it down ſo exactly.</p>
               <p>In the euening of the ſame day he returned inuiſibly from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus to Ieruſalem, 8 miles, where when the doores were all ſhut, and his diſciples were aſſembled together for feare of the Iewes, Ieſus came and ſtood in the midſt of them and ſaid, <hi>Peace be vnto you.</hi> And he ſhewed himſelfe to all his Diſciples except <hi>Thomas.
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:7153:243"/> Mark</hi> calleth this the firſt day of the Sabbath, that is, of the week,
<hi>Mark</hi> 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. for the Sabbath of the Iewes (as
<hi>Ioſep.</hi> witneſſeth) is not onely taken for a day of reſt, but alſo for the whole weeke: from whence is that ſaying in the Goſpel, <hi>Iejuniobis in Sabbato, i.</hi> I faſt twice in the weeke, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Vpon the 12 day of April, and eight daies after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he appeared again to dis diſciples, <hi>Thomas</hi> being then preſent and the dores ſhut; that hee might make euident that his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie was not tied to any ſecondary cauſes, or hindered by the property of any natural bodies, which according to S. <hi>Auſtin. Ser.</hi> 160. was ſo much the more wonderful, becauſe hee appeared vnto them ſubſtantially and effectually, not as a Phantaſma or Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow which vaniſheth away, and is without any corporiall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>In the ſame moneth of Aprill our Sauiour Chriſt appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to <hi>Peter, Thomas, Nathaniel,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> and other two Diſciples, as they were fiſhing vpon the ſhore of Tiberias, which ſtood 56 miles from Ieruſalem Northward, betweene Bethſaida and Capernaum, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. The day of this apparition is not ſet downe.</p>
               <p>From the ſea of Tiberias neere to Capernaum and Bethſaida, to mount Thabor ſcituated in Galile, is reckoned 10 miles: there about the end of April our Sauior Chriſt appeared to aboue
500 brethren at once, where many worſhipped him, &amp; others doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15. In the month of May our Sauior Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Iames</hi> the ſon of
<hi>Alpheus,</hi> for he had been ſeen before of <hi>Iames</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Zebedeus:</hi> both which were after crowned with martyrdom in the city Ieruſalem; the ſon of
<hi>Zebedeus</hi> vpon the 25 day of Iuly, ten yeares after the reſurrection; and the ſonne of
<hi>Alpheus</hi> vpon the feaſt day of the Paſſeouer was throwne from a Pinnacle of the Temple, 29 yeares after the reſurrection of our Sauior.</p>
               <p>Vpon the 40 day after his reſurrection hee returned fiftie ſixe miles to Ieruſalem, where his diſciples were aſſembled together: and vpon the fourteenth day of May, in the ſight of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:7153:243"/> with great triumph and ioy he aſcended vp into heauen, and ſitteth at the right hand of his father in diuine majeſtie and glory <hi>Mar. &amp; Luk. vlt. Act.</hi> 1.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 28. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. So theſe Trauels of our Sauior Chriſt were 319 miles. But if you reckon his trauels from the time of his infancie to the day of his aſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they make 3093 miles. Beſides his generall Viſitations and journies hither and thither, which were ſo many, that as <hi>Iohn</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, <hi>cap. vlt.</hi> they could not be deſcribed.</p>

Alſo though this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey throughout be very fruitfull and pleaſant, yet is it nothing ſo fertile and pleaſant as it was when the Children of Iſrael did dwell there.

For which cauſe it typically repreſenteth the Church, which is the light of the World, wherein are found many Chriſtians that bring forth pleaſant fruit, (good workes) relieuing the neceſſitie of ſuch as are in want, comforting the afflicted, &amp; patiently ſupporting the calamitie and miſery of this world, that ſo they might trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly rejoyce with Chriſt in that heauenly citie of Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>What things <hi>Zacharias</hi> hath ſpoken of this Mount in his laſt chapter, is to be vnderſtood of the preaching of the Goſpell, and propagation of the Church through all the world. Saint <hi>Ierom</hi>

It was built round, all of white poliſhed marble: vpon the top therof there is no roofe, but a window euen as Chriſt ſhould aſcend through it, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith in the life of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 40.

Euery man therefore ought to embrace a neerer way to ſaluation, than to follow thoſe monkiſh fables; and to ſeeke Chriſt in the holy Scripture, not vpon the Mount of Oliues, or amongſt ſand: for ſince the graue could not containe him, the Mount of Oliues cannot hold him, who now ſitteth at the right hand of his father, in power and eternall glory: but rather if wee be deſirous to ſee the footſteps of Chriſt, let vs ſeeke them in the Church, which is diſperſt through the world; wherein wee are ſufficiently taught how we ſhould follow him.</p>
               <p>The Palme is a famous tree which bringeth forth Dates; and is ſo called becauſe vpon the top the boughes are thicke and round, extending out like fingers; from whence it is called

About ſome fiftie paces towards the Eaſt of this ſepulchre of the bleſſed Virgin, cloſe by the foot of the mount of Oliues, ſtands a certain chappell, juſt in the place where ſometimes the towne of Gethſemane ſtood. Not far from this chappell is ſhowne a certaine hollow place vnder a rocke, where the inhabitants ſay our Sauiour ſweat drops of bloud.

But there haue beene many in this place ſince theſe times, which haue ſeene none of theſe things: from whence may be gathered, that they haue been idle deluſions vſed by ancient monkes to get money from Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and ſtrangers; and I haue here remembred them, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers knowing theſe, may beware of the like fallacies and deceits purpoſely inuented for lucres ſake.</p>

In this monument our Sauiour Chriſt was buried: And from this place vpon the third day early in the morning, he roſe; to the terrour and aſtoniſhment of ſuch as watched the ſepulchre. From whence may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That as our firſt parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> treſpaſſed againſt God, and loſt felicitie in a garden; ſo Chriſt the Sonne of God in a Garden made ſatisfaction for that ſinne; reſtored vs againe to grace, and make vs capable of heauenly felicitie. This ſepulchre (as it is deſcribed by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> when he went with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to ſee of that notable miracle of the reſurrection were true) was like a little chappel, the doore thereof being vpon the outſide, &amp; was but one roome without any diuiſion, ſo that a man might ſee all that was within it: for he ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.

<hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that they rolled a great ſtone to the doore of the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,

This Temple (as it was before it was deſtroied by the Saracens) is ſaid to be built all of white po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed marble, and beautified with ſtones of diuers colours, guilt with gold and ſiluer, couered on the outſide with lead to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſtormes and ſhowers of raine that happened; but the inſide was guilt all with ſplendant and refulgent gold, which caſt a wonderfull luſtre vpon the beholders. On either ſide of it were two walking galleries, one aboue, which was cloſe; and another below, which was open; extending themſelues the length of the ſanctuarie; all the roofe and vault being couered ouer with gold and artificiall worke: the one being ſupported with pillars of Marble, the other with poſts of wood plaited with ſiluer. There were alſo three gates towards the Eaſt, very fitly and fairely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, by which the multitude that reſorted thither, go in &amp; out: within theſe, there ſtood an arch, repreſenting after a ſort the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphaere of the Heauens, extended to the top of the ſanctuary like a circle, girded about with twelue pillars of equall bigneſſe, repreſenting the twelue Apoſtles, and vpon the top of this arch were placed cups of ſiluer, beautifully burniſhed.

This citie was ſometime called Ramathaim Sophim, and ſometime Ramah, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſcituated in a high place, and in times paſt was a fair citie ſtanding 16 miles from Ieruſalem toward the Northweſt, the deſcription whereof you may reade before. At this day it is called Ramalea; being nothing ſo farre as it was, but like a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey towne, the houſes being careleſſely diſperſed here and there, lying without walls or bulwarkes to defend it; notwithſtanding, the ancient ruins of the former city is to be ſeen euen at this day. There is alſo a great Inne or reſting place for ſtrangers, hauing within it many roomes for the receit of paſſengers, and a well of very ſweet water. This houſe was firſt purchaſed at the charge of <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of Burgondie, and by him committed to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Monkes of Mount Sion, by whom it is at this day made an hoſpitall, wherein pilgrims, trauellers, and ſtrangers are entertained and find much reliefe. In an inward Orchard belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to this hoſpital, there is a faire plot of ground that bringeth forth great aboundance of Aloes, of which there is often mention in the holy Scriptures, but more eſpecially in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 48. <hi>Thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſmell of Aloes and Caſsia, when thou commeſt out of thy Iuorie pallaces, where they haue made thee glad.</hi>

There is to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in India, Arabia, and the Holy land, a certaine herbe of an extraordinary ſweet ſmell, with leaues broad, fat and juicie, which being preſt yeeldeth more Aloes than honey; from whence this metaphoricall prouerbe is vſed, <hi>Quod plus moleſtiae quam voluptatis gignit,</hi> that is, more troubleſome than profitable.

               <head>Allegations of the Author to proue that <hi>Peter</hi> was neuer at Rome.</head>
               <p>BVt that <hi>Peter</hi> was twenty fiue yeares ſeuen moneths and fiue daies Biſhop and chiefe Prieſt at Rome, cannot be proued by the teſtimony of the Scripture, and is vtterly repugnant to the ſupputation and true accompt of the times. Firſt, becauſe it is manifeſt by that which hath beene ſaid, that he continued at Ieruſalem and in Iudaea during the time that <hi>Tiberius, Caligula,</hi> and <hi>Claudius</hi> were Emperours of Rome. And ſhortly after the martyrdome of <hi>Steuen,</hi> hee and <hi>Iohn</hi> were ſent into Samaria, that the Samaritans might alſo receiue the gift of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo in the third yere after his conuerſion, came to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and there ſpoke with
<hi>Peter,</hi> and remained with him fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene daies, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. Fourteene daies after the conuerſion of <hi>Paul, Peter</hi> was at the Apoſtolicall councell held in Ieruſalem; and there, with <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> gaue the right hand of fellowſhip to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that they ſhould goe and preach the Goſpell vnto the Gentiles; and that hee and the reſt would goe vnto the Iewes &amp; thoſe that were circumciſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. In the time of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Caeſar, Peter</hi> was committed to priſon by <hi>Herod Agrippa</hi> in Ieruſalem, and miraculouſly deliuered by the Angell of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. In the ninth yeare of <hi>Claudius Caeſar, Peter</hi> was at Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia in Syria, where <hi>Paul</hi> reſiſted him to his face, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. All theſe things manifeſtly proue that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was not at Rome at ſuch time as any of theſe three, <hi>viz. Tiberius, Caligula</hi> and <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> were Emperors; but either in Ieruſalem, or elſe at Antiochla in Syria.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may axactly bee made euident out of the holy, Scriptures, that <hi>Peter</hi> was not at Rome in the time of <hi>Nero.</hi> For in the ſecond yeare of <hi>Nero, Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtle to the Romans, and ſent it from Corinth by the hand of <hi>Phebe:</hi> in which Epiſtle he ſaluted all his friends which he had in that citie, by name, as by the concluſion of the Epiſtle more plainely appeareth; but there is no mention of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> who (if that at time Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb facs="tcp:7153:252"/> of that place) ſurely ſhould not haue bin omitted. Alſo in the fift yeare of
<hi>Nero, Paul</hi> being then in priſon at Rome, wrot his Epiſtles to the Galatians, Epheſians, Philippians, Coloſſians, and to <hi>Philemon;</hi> and in the concluſion of theſe Epiſtles he expreſſely nameth all his friends that he had in Rome, yet makes no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Peter.</hi> And when he was the ſecond time in priſon vnder <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> in the laſt yeare of the reigne of this Emperour, hee wrot from Rome his ſecond Epiſtle to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> beeing a little before his death, at the end of which Epiſtle he plainly ſhewes that he had no companion there but <hi>Luke,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. From whence it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that <hi>Peter</hi> during all the pilgrimage and life of <hi>Paul,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at Rome: how then can it poſſible be, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome for the ſpace of almoſt 26 yeares? Truly there are many learned men, and they alſo of great iudgement, which hold this opinion falſe, and vtterly repugnant to holy Scripture, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be proued by any good Authors or hiſtories. But if <hi>Peter</hi> were euer at Rome, hee came thither after the laſt impriſonment of <hi>Paul,</hi> and a few daies before his martyrdom. Becauſe (as <hi>Onu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrius</hi> ſaith, <hi>in Comment. faſt. lib.</hi> 2. alſo <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul. cont.

                  <p>After the firſt deſolation, becauſe the countrey round about this citie was very fertile and pleaſant, abounding with ſprings, riuers, vines, oliue gardens, mountaines, fruitfull valleyes, faire cities, and ſtrong caſtles and townes; <hi>Herod Aſcalonites</hi> (that great King of the Iewes, who put to death the innocent children) ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified it, ſet vp many goodly buildings beautified with marble pillars and pleaſant walkes: and alſo in the circuit of the Kings houſe, and vnder the buildings of the nobilitie in the common Market place, the houſes and vaults were ſupported with marble pillars, according to the maner of the Iewes. The pallace (callled the K. houſe, ſtood in the midſt of the citie, vpon the top of the mountain: and round about it there were diuers other buildings ſet vp, but much lower, euen about the deſcent of the mountaine; yet ſo ſcituated, that the inhabitants might ſee out of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the country round about. Then cloſe to the pallace in the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the citie, he cauſed a temple to be built in honor of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus.</hi> Thus hauing finiſhed the inſide, he compaſt it about with a mighty wall, and vpon that placed many turrets: &amp; then to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> called it by the name of Sebaſten, which among the Grecians ſignifies
<hi>Auguſtum &amp; venerabile principem:</hi> now although this citie was very glorious and ſpatious in thoſe times (for it was three miles about) yet at this day it is vtterly ruined &amp; deſtroied, inſomuch, that there is not a houſe ſtanding, two Churches only excepted, which were built in honour of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt: and the chief of theſe, which was the Cathedrall Church, the Saracens haue conuerted to their vſe, ſo that at this day
<hi>Mahomet</hi> is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipt in it. In this ſtood the Sepulchre of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, cut out in marble, like the ſepulchre of Chriſt, where (as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith) he lieth buried between <hi>Eliſha</hi> &amp; <hi>Obediah</hi> the Prophets. This church ſtands vpon the ſide of the mountaine, in the deſcent.</p>
                  <p>The Saracens do principally reuerence S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Yet they prefer <hi>Mahomet</hi> before both, becauſe they hold him a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger ſent of God, not vnto all men, but onely vnto the Saracens and Turks, and their ſubiects.</p>
                  <p>The other Church which ſtood in Samaria, was vpon the top of the mountain which ſomtimes the Kings palace ſtood. In this Church in times paſt there dwelt certain Grecian Monks, which were Chriſtians, and entertained Chriſtian Pilgrims with great humanitie, and furniſhed them with many neceſſaries.</p>
                  <p>But the city of Samaria it ſelfe hath bin ſo often ouerthrown, and brought to ſuch extreme miſerie, that almoſt all the ground where it ſtood is at this time conuerted into an Olive garden.

There are not ſo many ruins found through all the land of Iudaea (though there haue bin many worthy cities deſtroyed) as are in this place at this day.

Wherefore thoſe that were his flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, hearing his gratious ſpeech, cried with a loud voice, <hi>O Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa be propitious vnto vs; for although heretofore we feared thee as a man, yet now we well perceiue thou art of a more noble and Diuine nature.</hi> But when the King (taking delight in theſe ſpeeches) would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the impious clamour of theſe flatterers, a little after he lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp his head, and vpon the top of a pillar he ſaw an Owle ſitting ouer him. Preſently he was troubled in his minde, and within a while after hee was ſtrooke with an extreme paine in his bowels, inſomuch that with a loud voice he cried out vnto his friends, <hi>I whom but now was called your god, am but a man; and him that you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be immortall, muſt preſently die.</hi> Theſe words being ended, they caried him ſick into his palace, and it was giuen out that he was dead.</p>
               <p>No ſooner came this newes to the eares of the vulgar, but they with their wiues and children put on ſack-cloath, and fell vpon
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:7153:255"/> the ground with earneſt ſupplications to God to bee mercifull vnto him. But the King looking out of his window and ſeeing them lie thus proſtrate vpon the earth, wailing and weeping, he could not abſtain from teares. At the length after he had beene cruelly tormented by the ſpace of foure dayes, vpon the fift dyed, beeing the ſecond of Auguſt, the wormes hauing conſumed his guts, and eaten through his body. Thus God grieuouſly puniſhed him, who had ſo much afflicted the members of the Church of Chriſt: but towards other men, as well ſtrangers as Gentiles, hee was milde and courteous. He raigned in the whole almoſt ſeuen yeares; for he held the Tetrarchy of <hi>Philip</hi> three yeares vnder <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula,</hi> and other foure yeares he held the whole kingdome of the Iewes. He died in the eleuenth yeare after the reſurrection, and in the third of <hi>Claudius Caeſar,</hi> being then about 54 yeres of age,

Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith in his Epitaph vpon <hi>Paul,</hi> that in his time (which was 400 yeares after Chriſt) there was to be ſeene in this place the houſe of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion, whom <hi>Peter</hi> baptized, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. (This <hi>Cornelius</hi> is thought by ſome to haue been of the family of the Lentuli in Rome, for they were alſo called Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lij, as appeareth in Saluſt in the conſpiracy of Cataline: &amp; it may be that this <hi>Cornelius</hi> was that
<hi>Lentulus</hi> which wrot to <hi>Tiberius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> that excellent Epiſtle, concerning the figure, proportion, and perſon of our Lord and Sauior Ieſus Chriſt.) Alſo the houſe of <hi>Philip</hi> the deacon, and the chambers of his foure daughters who were Propheteſſes. When <hi>Paul</hi> came vnto this towne, <hi>Agabus</hi> the Prophet came vnto him, who bound his hands and feet with the girdle of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The man that oweth this girdle ſhal be thus bound by the Iewes at Ieruſalem, and they ſhall deliuer him into the hands of the Gentiles.</hi> Here he made a notable ſermon before <hi>Feſtus, Agrippa Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> and his ſiſter <hi>Bernice, Act.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>This towne flouriſhed for a long time after the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, and it was ſcituated in a faire and profitable place, fortified towards the Weſt with the Mediterranean ſea, and
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:7153:255"/> towards the Eaſt it was compaſſed about with a lake, in which were great aboundance of Crocodiles, though the water was very ſweet, and of a great depth. Many godly and religious men were here crowned with the wreath of martyrdome, for profeſſing the Goſpel of Chriſt, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of this town and of Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius well obſerueth in his <hi>Eccleſ.

There was alſo another town built by <hi>Philip</hi> the Tetrarch, called Caeſarea Philippi, whereof you may reade before.</p>

                  <p>THis was the metropolitan city of Ionia, ſcituated in Aſia minor, 544 miles from Ieruſalem Northweſtward. It was built (ſaith <hi>Strabo</hi>) by <hi>Androclus</hi> the ſon of
<hi>Codrus</hi> king of Athens, in the time of <hi>Dauid</hi> King of Iſrael, and becauſe of the beautifull ſcituation and fertilitie of the ſoile called Epheſus: in future A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges growing into ſuch credit and eſtimation, that it was mightily encreaſed, and became one of the moſt famous mart townes in all Aſia; but it ſtood ſomewhat low, ſo that the ſea brake in vpon it and drowned it, and many of the inhabitants periſhed. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> K. of Thrace built it vp again in the place where now it ſtands, and called it Arſinoës, after his wiues name. But he being dead, it was againe called by the antient name Epheſus. There were many worthy men that liued in it, as <hi>Heraclitus, Scoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Hermadorus,</hi> who for his excellent vnderſtanding &amp; ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar honeſtie was baniſhed.
<hi>Hipponachus</hi> alſo the Poet, <hi>Perrhaſius</hi> &amp; <hi>Apelles</hi> the Painters,
<hi>Alexander</hi> the orator, and <hi>Theodotio</hi> a Iew, who interpreted the Bible. It was in antient times inhabited by the
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:7153:257"/> Amazons, whoſe queen kept her court there, and wonderfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and adorned it with faire and beautifull buildings. Here alſo that notable Temple dedicated to

<hi>ca.</hi> 14. was 220 yeares a building. It ſtood vpon mooriſh ground to auoid the danger of earthquakes. There were in it 127 pillars, erected by ſo many Kings; among which there were 36 that were curiouſly ſieled, and artificially carued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen: it was 425 foot long, &amp;

There were ſo many gifts &amp; gratuities ſent from all the cities and kings round about, toward the building of this Temple, that the riches and treaſure thereof was wonderfull; inſomuch that when it was finiſhed, it was accounted one of the ſtatelieſt buildings the world could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and numbered amongſt the wonders of the world. This tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thus built at ſuch an extraordinarie charge that it was almoſt vnvaluable, was ſet on fire by one <hi>Heroſtratus</hi> a wicked &amp; peruerſe fellow (in the ſame Olympiad and day that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was borne) who hauing nothing in him that might make him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in after-ages, burnt this goodly building, that ſo (though not for his good, but for his euill) he might get a name. But the Epheſians were ſo inſenced becauſe of this miſchiefe, that they procured proclamation to bee made through all the kingdomes round about, that his name ſhould not be once mentioned: which perhaps for a time was obſerued, but in future ages they could not preuent it, but that he was both ſpoken of &amp; written of. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding afterward the inhabitants of this City became ſo exceeding wealthy, that they ſoon after rebuilt this temple of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> and made it much fairer than it was before; all the Citiſens contributing with willing hands to the charge of the building: inſomuch that the women brought all their ſiluer, gold, and other pretious ornaments, and communicated them towards this great worke.</p>
                  <p>Alſo in after-times thoſe faire pillars before ſpoken of, were againe erected; towards the rebuilding whereof they receiued ſo many and wonderfull gifts, from all the neighbouring Kings, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Countries, that this Temple might (as it was thought)
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:7153:258"/> compare with all the world beſide for riches and treaſure. It was ſtanding in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, who came thither about 12 yeares after the reſurrection of our Sauior, and continued there three yeares; in which time he ſo faithfully and diligently preached the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that he conuerted moſt of the Citiſens, from their idolatry and worſhip of <hi>Diana,</hi> to the reuerend knowledge and confeſſion of our bleſſed Sauior. For which cauſe <hi>Demetrius</hi> the ſiluer ſmith (who made a great gain by idolatry) ſtirred vp a great tumult; ſo that the Gentiles running vp and down the City for two houres ſpace, cried out with a loud voice, <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the Epheſians, Acts</hi> 19. Here alſo <hi>Paul</hi> fought with beaſts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. And to this city
<hi>Paul</hi> wrot his Epiſtle, and ſent it from Rome, 996 miles. He made <hi>Timothy</hi> alſo a Biſhop of this city, to whom he wrot two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles; the firſt was ſent him from Laodicea to Phrygia, beeing 280 miles: the ſecond from Rome, as I ſaid. By theſe Epiſtles
<hi>Timothy</hi> was greatly comforted, and taught them to his diſciples and auditors, that ſo they might conſtantly continue &amp; perſeuer in the Chriſtian faith and religion to the end. To conclude, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangeliſt came alſo to Epheſus, &amp; wrot his Goſpel againſt the heretick <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> who denied Chriſt to be the true God; for which cauſe God grieuouſly puniſhed him, ſo that he died as hee was bathing himſelfe in a bath,

                  <p>THis was another of the townes whereto <hi>Iohn</hi> wrot his <hi>Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> It was a famous city, and metropolitan of Myſia, ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in Aſia minor, 228 miles from Ieruſalem Northweſtward. It ſtood vpon a high rock cloſe by the riuer Caicus, from whence it was called Pergamus. For in antient times all famous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table places were called amongſt the Graecians Pergama, as <hi>Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and <hi>Servius</hi> obſerueth. <hi>Strabo, lib.</hi> 13. ſaith, That in the time of <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Agathocles</hi> (who was one of the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great) it was but a caſtle; in which place becauſe of the ſtrength of it, he vſually kept all his treaſures, and thoſe things that were of account, and committed the cuſtody of it vnto one named <hi>Philetaerus,</hi> an Eunuch of Tyanus. But this man being accuſed to <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> That he would haue forced his wife
<hi>Arſinoës,</hi> for feare of ſome future puniſhment becauſe of that offence, moued the inhabitants of that Hold to rebellion. At
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:7153:259"/> the ſame time alſo there happened many commotions in Aſia, whereby
<hi>Lyſimachus</hi> was conſtrained to leaue this, and make op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt
<hi>Seleucus Nicanor,</hi> who had inuaded his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But in this war <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> was ſlaine. And <hi>Philetaerus</hi> hauing in his poſſeſſion great riches, that hee might enioy what hee had, was alwayes obſeruant to him that gat the victorie, by which meanes he kept himſelfe and his riches for the ſpace of 20 yeares in that caſtle; and then dyed, and left all his wealth to <hi>Eumenes</hi> his brothers ſonne, who inlarged his gouernment, and ouercame <hi>Antiochus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Seleucus.</hi> This man after hee had raigned 32 yeares dyed, and <hi>Attalus</hi> his ſonne ſucceeded him in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment, who hauing conquered Galatia made a league with the Romans, and by them was firſt called by the name of a King. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him ſucceeded his ſon <hi>Eumenes</hi> the ſecond of that name, who aided the Romanes againſt <hi>Antiochus magnus</hi> King of Syria; for which ſeruice the Romans gaue him all the dominions that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> had on this ſide the Alps. This man was the firſt that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged the caſtle of Pergamus, and made it a goodly city, planting round about it a thick wood or grove, and called it Nicephorus. And after he had reigned 49 yeares he died, and left his kingdom to his ſon <hi>Attalus,</hi> called <hi>Philometor.</hi> This <hi>Attalus</hi> after hee had done many notable exploits, died without iſſue, when hee had reigned 5 yeares, and left his kingdome to the Romans, who tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it into a prouince.</p>
                  <p>There liued in this town many learned men, as <hi>Galen</hi> the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, who was famous in the time of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor, and (as the fame went) liued 140 yeares. Of that town alſo was <hi>Apolodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> the Rhetoritian, who was ſchoole-maſter to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> of which man the Apollodorean ſect tooke name, and <hi>Dionyſius At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> his ſcholer. Here <hi>Antipas</hi> was crowned with the Wreath of martyrdome.</p>
                  <p>To the Biſhop of this Towne <hi>Iohn</hi> wrot his Reuelation, and in the ſecond Chapter thereof ſharpely reprehendeth him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he bore with the ſect of the Nicholaitans; which although it laſted not long, yet it was very dangerous. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, That
<hi>Nicholaus</hi> one of the ſeuen Deacons for the poore at Antiochia, of whom you may reade,
<hi>Act. cap.</hi> 6. was the firſt author of this ſect:
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:7153:260"/> yet <hi>Clem.

                  <p>The opinion that this Sect held (as <hi>Euſeb.</hi> ſaith, <hi>li.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 23. and <hi>Irenaeus, libr.</hi> 1. Chap. 27.) was, That women were to be common, That it was lawful to eat meat offered to Idols; That fornication and Adultery was no ſin: beſide many other wicked and peruerſe opinions concerning the Deity, which would be too tedious to recite in this place. You may read more of it in <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian.</hi>

               <head>The Trauels of the holy Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> with an axact annotation of the times.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>PAul</hi> was borne at Tarſus in Cicilia, about the tenth yeare of the natiuitie of our Sauiour; and was neere about the age of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt, as the circumſtances of Hiſtories doe declare. After he grew to ſome bigneſſe, he was ſent by his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from thence to Ieruſalem, being 304 miles; where he had not beene long brought vp with
<hi>Gamaliel</hi> (which ſignifies, The recompence of God) <hi>Acts</hi> 22. but he became the Diſciple of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the juſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Paul</hi> was of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin, Phil.</hi> 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and being yet but a young man, he was one of thoſe that kept the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the holy Martyr S.
<hi>Stephen,</hi> who was ſtoned about the end of the foure and thirtieth yeare after the natiuitie of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. at which time alſo S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt was but foure and twentie yeares of age. If therefore you would obſerue the age of the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> in this following diſcourſe of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, deduct ten from the yeres after the natiuitie of our Sauiour Chriſt, and the remainder is his age. At his circumciſion he was called <hi>Saul,</hi> that is, <hi>a mortall man:</hi> but when he was made the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the Gentiles, he was called <hi>Paul;</hi> of which name there was a noble family in Rome, ſo called becauſe of the lowneſſe of their ſtature, and ſmalneſſe of their body; as <hi>Carolus Sigonius</hi> obſerueth.</p>
               <p>In the 35 yeare after the natiuitie of Chriſt <hi>Paul</hi> was an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor for priuate hereſie, and a cruel perſecutor of the Goſpel. The next yeare he went from Ieruſalem to Damaſcus in Syria, which was 160 miles: in which journey (about the 25 day of Ianuary) he was conuerted; and vpon the 28 day of Ianuary was baptized by <hi>Ananias.</hi> So he ſtaied ſome few daies in Damaſcus, and taught the Goſpell of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi>
22.</p>
               <p>In the ſame yere that he was conuerted, the Iewes &amp; thoſe that were enemies to the Goſpell, went about by deceit to take his
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:7153:263"/> life; wherefore he went from Damaſcus to Arabia Petraea, which was 160 miles; here hee continued teaching the Goſpell by the ſpace of three yeares, that is, from the beginning of the 35 to the end of the 37 yeare after the Natiuitie of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi>
9.</p>
               <p>In the 38 yeare after the Natiuitie of Chriſt he returned from Arabia Petraea and came to Damaſcus, which was 160 miles; and there he diligently taught the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But when in the ſame yeare <hi>Araeta</hi> King of Arabia went about to put him ſecretly to death, he was let down in a basket ouer the wall, and ſo went from Damaſcus to Ieruſalem, which was 160 miles: and when hee came thither he brought <hi>Barnabas</hi> to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and ſhewed them his conuerſion, and remained with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 15 daies preaching the Goſpell. At this time he ſaw <hi>Iames</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Alpheus</hi> and brother of our Lord,
<hi>Acts</hi> 9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Galat.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>But when his aduerſaries that were at Ieruſalem went about ſecretly to put him to death, hee went from Ieruſalem and was brought by the brethren to Caeſarea Strato, which was 32 miles,
<hi>Acts</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>About the 38 yere after the natiuitie of Chriſt he went thence into Syria to Tarſus a citie of Cilicia, which was 272 miles: here he continued ſome yeares teaching the Goſpell of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>In the 41 yeare after the natiuitie of Chriſt, and about the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth yeare of his Miniſtrie, hee was brought by <hi>Barnabas</hi> from Tarſus to Antiochia in Syria, which was
120 miles. At this time and in this towne all thoſe that beleeued in Chriſt began to bee called Chriſtians, wheras before they were called Diſciples and brothers, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. Theſe things hapned in the eight yeare after the reſurrection of Chriſt: about this time alſo
<hi>Matthew</hi> wrote his Goſpell, and <hi>Agabus</hi> propheſied of the vniuerſall dearth that ſhould happen vnder <hi>Claudius, Acts</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>In the 42 yeare after the natiuitie of Chriſt, <hi>Paul</hi> being then at Antiochia, and about 32 yeres of age, was wrapt vp into the third heauen, 14 yeares before he wrote his ſecond Epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>In the 43 yeare after the natiuitie of Chriſt, the famine wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:7153:263"/> 
                  <hi>Agabus</hi> prophecied, being now begun, hee went with the gifts of the Church from Antiochia to Ieruſalem, which was 280 miles: this yeare <hi>Iames</hi> the elder was beheaded at the command of <hi>Agrippa, Acts</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>In the 44 yeare after the natiuitie of Chriſt, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> with
<hi>Peter,</hi> were deliuered out of priſon by the Angell of the Lord. Now hauing diſtributed the gifts of the Church, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in the company of <hi>Iohn Marke,</hi> from Ieruſalem to Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, which was 280 miles. So theſe trauels were 1928 miles.</p>

<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, making warre vpon that Prince, amongſt others, brought his Army againſt this citie: but the citiſens hearing of his notable exployts, durſt not abide his
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:7153:264"/> comming: therefore they fired the citie, left hee ſhould make a prey of their riches, and fled: which when <hi>Alexander</hi> perceiued, he gaue order to <hi>Parmenio</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed to quench the fire, and ſaue the citie. In the meane time the King (being preſt with an extraordinary thirſt, by reaſon of the extreame heate that was in that country, the duſt, and his long journie) put off his roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all garments, and caſt himſelfe into the riuer Cydnus, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cold water comming out of the North, ſtroke the heat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inward, and ſo benummed his ſinewes, that had it not been for the preſent helpe of his ſouldiers, and the extraordinarie dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care of <hi>Philip</hi> his Phiſitian, he had died immediately; notwithſtanding, by the great prouidence of God, and the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of his phyſitian, hee recouered his dangerous ſickeneſſe beyond the expectation of man; and after ouercame <hi>Darius</hi> in a ſharpe and cruell warre, neere to a place called Iſſa, as you may reade before, See <hi>Plutarch in vita Alexand.</hi> and
<hi>Quintus Curtius.</hi> From that time forward this citie grew to be very famous, and daily increaſed in ſtatelineſſe and faire buildings. And to adde more dignitie to it, there was a famous Academie, in which were many learned and rare Philoſophers; in ſo much that they of Tharſus exceeded the Philoſophers of Athens and Alexandria for learning and knowleged, though indeed for number of ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and common reſort they exceeded Tharſus.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was borne and brought vp in this Towne, and here learned the knowledge of the tongues, Philoſophie, and other good arts. Hee alſo peruſed the writings of <hi>Aratus, Epimenides; Menander,</hi> and other learned men, whoſe ſayings are here and there diſperſed through his Epiſtles. From thence he was ſent to Ieruſalem, where hee liued and was brought vp at the feet of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel,</hi> who was Prouoſt of that Academy: and after, was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be an Apoſtle of Chriſt Ieſus, as appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> 22. This towne at this day is ſubject to the Empire of the Turkes, and called by the name of Teraſſa; beeing neither ſo famous nor ſo faire a citie, as in the time when the Roman Empire flouriſhed; for then, becauſe of the extraordinary vertue of the citizens, it was indowed with the libertie and freedome of Rome.</p>

                  <p>THis was a metropolitan towne in Syria, diſtant from Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem 160 miles towards the Northeaſt; being an ancient and faire citie, and, before ſuch time as Antiochia was built, the head of all that kingdome. It was ſcituated in a faire and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full place, cloſe by the mountaine Libanus, which bringeth forth Frankincenſe, Ceders, Cypreſſe, and many odoriferous and ſweet ſmelling floures. There were many Kings that kept their court in it, as <hi>Hadad, Benhadad</hi> the firſt, <hi>Benhadad</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Haſael,</hi> and others, who grieuouſly oppoſed the Kings of Iſrael in many ſharpe and cruell warres, as you may reade before. The land round about it aboundeth with white and red Roſes, Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats, Almonds, Figges, and other ſweet and pleaſant fruits. In that place the Alablaſter ſtone is found, very faire and cleere. The aire, pleaſant and healthfull. The riuer called Chryſorrus, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth cloſe by it, in which there is found golden veines which yeelded perfect gold. The houſes without are not very curious; but within, all of poliſhed Marble and Alablaſter guilt with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent gold, ſo artificially that it dazleth the beholders eies.</p>
                  <p>There was a certaine Florentine who reuolted from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, and obtained to be chiefe gouernour of this towne; in which he erected a ſtrong and beautifull caſtle, which ſtood for the defence of it. No man can ſufficiently expreſſe the beautie and glory of this citie: there is great traffique, and much reſort of people to it, but eſpecially of Turkes, Saracens, Mamalucks, and other kinds of Pagan people, who are preferred before the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in that gouernment: and although there are many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in that place, yet they are conſtrained to indure great injurie by thoſe Barbarians, becauſe they are hated euen to the death: and if any of them chance to die, they are buried in that place where <hi>Paul</hi> was conuerted. The inhabitants ſhew the place where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was let downe ouer the wall in a basket; alſo the houſe of <hi>Ananias,</hi> who cured the blindneſſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> beſides many other things that are memorable in that citie, of which you may reade in

<hi>Petraea</hi> is ſo called from the Metropolitan citie thereof, called Petra, which is ſcituated forty miles from Ieruſalem towards the South, and bordereth vpon Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt and India. It is alſo called Arabia Nabathea, as you may reade before. Paran and Sur are a part of it, compaſſing towards the Eaſt the land of Iudaea, and ſo extendeth to Damaſcus. This countrey is very full of rockes and ſtones, the chiefe citie Petra being ſcituated vpon a rocke, of which it taketh the name. Here ſtandeth the mountaines Horeb and Sinai; here the children of Iſrael trauelled when they went out of Aegypt; here is the <hi>Sardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi> ſtone found; and the people of this countrey in times paſt were great Prophets and Aſtrologians; here alſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught the Goſpell a little after his conuerſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. at which time <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> was King thereof, whoſe ſiſter was married to <hi>Herod</hi> the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch of Galile and Petraea; but he caſt her off, and married <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodias</hi> his brother
<hi>Philips</hi> wife, vpon which there began a bloudy warre betweene <hi>Aretas</hi> and
<hi>Herod,</hi> and a ſharpe battell was fought neere to Gamala a citie beyond Iordan. And although the two Kings were not at this battell, yet by the treaſon and flight of the ſoldiers out of Tracones, (who without all queſtion would haue reuenged the contempt done vnto their Lord
<hi>Philip</hi>) the Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an armie carried away a notable victory, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>lib. antiq.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Aretas</hi> ſignifieth, An excellent man; which was a common name to the Kings of Arabia.

                  <p>The other part of Arabia is called by <hi>Ptolomie, Deſerta;</hi> but <hi>Strabo</hi> calls it, <hi>Scenilis,</hi> becauſe the inhabitants thereof are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out buildings or Tents, and liue like vagrants vp and downe the woods.

In this expedition they vſed much pillage and robbing vpon the Seas; and through many dangers came at length to this Iſle, landed their men, wan the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, fired a great part of it, and put many of the inhabitants to the ſword: with this victorie, moſt of his armie which were more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious than the reſt, would haue willingly left the countrey; but
<hi>Brennus</hi> who beforetimes had beene vſed to ſacriledge, and thoſe that were as couetous as himſelfe, thought it baſeneſſe through an opinion of holineſſe to leaue ſo great a bootie behind them as was contained in the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> (for that place of all the Temples of the world in thoſe times was notorious for riches and treaſure, the many and great gratuities and offerings of moſt Princes, which were both magnificent and rich, being hoarded vp in the ſecret caues of this Oracle) wherefore they attempted the aſſault, but with bad ſucceſſe, for the diuell raiſed ſuch a tempeſt, with thundring, lightning, and other ſtrange and vncoth acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, that <hi>Brennus</hi> in this diſtemperature of the aire was<note n="*" place="margin">Some ſay he killed himſelf with his owne dagger.</note> ſlaine, many of his ſhippes were ſet on fire, and the greateſt part of

Such euent had this ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious attempt. Thoſe that remained, after they had gathered themſelues into a body, went thence into Aſia the leſſe, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelues in this country; where the inhabitants in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time called them Gallo-Graecians, adding their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall name to that of the countrey wherein they liued: and after, for beauties ſake, they were called Galatians, See <hi>Liu. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus, lib.</hi> 6. ſaith, That the inhabitants of Galatia were ſo called of this people, in the time that <hi>Gidion</hi> iudged Iſrael, &amp; that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was Emperour of Perſia; both may be true, conſidering the mutabilitie and change of States in thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>Some thinke they were firſt called Galatians by <hi>Attalus</hi> King of Pergamus, (who gaue them a great ouerthrow cloſe by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Halym) becauſe they originally were of Gallia, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſometime in Graecia, and after came into Aſia; ſo he joyning theſe two names into one, called them Gallo-Graecians, or Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians. This hiſtory is diuerſly reported by diuers authors; but all conclude that they reſted and inhabited in Aſia, where their poſteritie continued to this day.</p>
                  <p>In times paſt it was a very warlike and generous nation, and in their expedition performed many noble exploits, attaining to eminence onely by their ſword; for which cauſe many Princes neere them were beholding vnto them for their aide: but withall, cruell and barbarous, inſomuch as they oftentimes eat their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues or offered them to their gods; and thus they continued for the ſpace of 300 yeares, till <hi>Paul</hi> comming into that countrey preached the Goſpell amongſt them, and conuerted them from this Barbariſme to the Chriſtian faith. He ſent an Epiſtle to this people from Rome, being 1200 miles. They in thoſe times held all Paphligonia, a part of Phrigia, Cappadocia, and of all the neighbouring countries thereabouts, which after their names was called Gallo Graecia or Galatia: ſuch a mightie nation was this growne in a ſhort time, at firſt being a people thruſt out of theit owne countrey for want of a place to inhabit in, as you may reade more at large in the fifth booke of <hi>Liuie,</hi> whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie I haue principally followed herein.</p>

                  <p>It lay waſte ſo long (although it had bin a faire and goodly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the like not in the world) that the place where it ſtood was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like a plain field, only here and there ſome heaps of old ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins, to ſhew that there had been a city in that place.

                  <p>A long time after there were a certain people that called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Trojans, who rebuilt it, but not in the ſame place, and in it erected a goodly Temple in honour of the goddeſſe

But after he had ended the Perſian war, and conquered almoſt all the knowne world, he ſent very kinde and louing letters to theſe new Trojans, promiſing not only to inlarge the towne, and endow it with ma-priuiledges and reuenues, but alſo to build vp a faire and ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Temple there, as

At firſt it was but a caſtle, and called after his name Siſiphyus: but after, becauſe of the ſtrength of the place, and pleaſant ſcituation, it became a faire towne, and called by the name of Corcyra, as <hi>Strabo</hi> faith; then Ephym, of <hi>Ephyra,</hi> who was a faire and goodly Nymph, and Queen of that place. Now although euen in thoſe times it was held in great eſtimation, yet it became much waſted and decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the continuance of time, vntill it was repaired by King <hi>Corinthus</hi> (who as ſome thinke was the ſonne of <hi>Marathon

                  <p>It was a faire and goodly citie, very commodiouſly built, for it ſtood betweene the two ſeas of Ionium and Aegeum, ſo that there reſorted thither great multitude of Merchants from all places, Cloſe by the citie there ſtood a ſteepe mountaine, which was as it were a bulwarke for the defence thereof, being 560 feet high, and called Acrocorinthus, that is, <hi>the glory and ſtrength of the Corinthians.</hi> It was alſo compaſſed about with ſtrong walls, and beautified with many goodly buildings and temples, but aboue the reſt, the Temple of
<hi>Venus</hi> was had in great reputation, which (as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith) ſtood vpon the top of the mountaine Acrocorin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, wherein there were aboue a thouſand Maides proſtituted euery yeare. This Temple was had in ſuch great honour, and was ſo gloriouſly built, that aboue all the places of the world there was reſort vnto it. Cloſe by it ſtood the ancient caſtle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Syſyphius, built all of white Marble; and a little below that, the fountaine of Pyrene dedicated to the Muſes.</p>
                  <p>There were many mightie Princes that ruled in this citie, as <hi>Alethes</hi> who was King thereof at ſuch time as <hi>Samuel</hi> judged Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, which was 1103 yeares before Chriſt; hee beſtowed great coſt vpon it, ſet vp many faire and goodly buildings, and ruled ouer it thirtie and fiue yeares, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith. After him there ſucceeded many Kings, by whoſe worthineſſe and proweſſe it was ſo much inlarged, and made ſo famous, that it was little infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the citie of Rome: for at ſuch time as Embaſſadors were ſent thence to intreate of ſome buſineſſe concerning the ſtate, the Corinthians did not let to giue them many reprochfull tearmes, as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 8. becauſe of which inſolencie the Romans ſent <hi>Lucius Mummus</hi> the Conſul, into Graetia, who beſieged Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, and within a ſhort time tooke it, and burnt it downe to the ground, in the yeare before Chriſt, 145, of which you may reade more in <hi>Florus,</hi> and in the ſecond Decad of
<hi>Lyuie.</hi> It was a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous rich Towne, and abounded with gold, ſiluer, and coſtly braſſe, alſo with plate, and curious pictures: ſo that although <hi>Mummius</hi> conquered Corinth, yet Corinth conquered Rome;
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:7153:277"/> for the citizens thereof were ſo bewitched with the riches and glory of this towne, that they forgot their ancient ſeueritie, and with violence followed their vices, as
<hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. So that as before Corinth abounded with luxurie and diuers other abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable euils, as whoredome, adulterie, fornication, couetouſnes, idolatry, rapine, and murther: ſo Rome in future ages became as bad or worſe than it.</p>
                  <p>Thus it continued waſte from that time till <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was Emperour of Rome, who hauing trauelled into thoſe parts of the world, and ſeene the ruines of this citie, and the profitale ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for traffique, cauſed it to be rebuilded: after which time it began to grow great &amp; ſpacious, little inferiour to the former in glory, and no leſſe corrupted with vices, hauing forgot the former miſerie which it ſuſtained by the hands of the Romans; and ſo continued from the yeare before Chriſt 44, vntill the yeare after Chriſt 41, at which time <hi>Paul</hi> came thither &amp; preached the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, by whoſe diuine doctrine and godly life and conuerſation, they were conuerted from their euill courſes, and liued more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily and honeſtly, as appeareth by the two Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote from Philippos to the inhabitants of this towne.</p>
                  <p>But after, they falling from their faith and forſaking their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient integritie, the Lord puniſhed them with a ſecond deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for at ſuch time as <hi>Amurath</hi> Emperor of the Turkes grew to eminencie, and had conquered Theſſalonica, Boaetia, and Attica, he came into this Iſthums, and made all Peloponeſſus tributary to him. Then after him <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond (although the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Corinth had fortified their citie with three walls, and made it ſo ſtrong that it was thought to be almoſt inuincible) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged it and woon it, <hi>An.

                  <p>THe Iſland of Creta tooke the name (as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith) from the people called Curetes that dwelt in this Iſland: thoſe people vſed to cut all the haire off from the foreparts of their heads, and therefore they would not endure to ſuffer any man to weare his haire being in the warres; for which cauſe in the Grecian tongue they were called <hi>Couretes,</hi> and in time this name by corruption of ſpeech was changed, and they called Cretans. This Iſland ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the Mediterranean ſea, between Graecia and Africa, 600
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:7153:283"/> miles from Ieruſalem toward the Weſt. It is a great Iſland, being 200 miles long, 48 miles broad, and in compaſſe 588 miles: it is very fruitfull of Cypreſſe trees, Malmſey, Sugar, and other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: the Malmſey taketh the name from the towne of Malueſia, in Peloponeſſus, ſtanding vpon the point of Malta, right ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Creta or Candia; and at this day the like wine is made in Creta, and called by the ſame name, from whence it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought vnto vs, though in times paſt it came out of this Iſland of Chius.</p>
                  <p>Among all the hills that are found in the Iſland of Creta, the hill Ida is moſt ſpoken of, becauſe of the height: about it ſtandeth diuers townes and villages: it hath many hills and woods; for the Iſland is very full of ſweet Cypreſſe trees, inſomuch that there are woods full of them. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, that vpon a time there was ſuch an Earthquake in this Iſland, that one of the hills remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, out of which there came a man being forty cubits high. In this Iſland there are no venomous beaſts, but in times paſt it was inhabited by cruell people, of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Titus, cap.</hi> 1. where he rehearſeth the ſaying of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides,</hi> which was after this manner, <hi>The people of Creta are alwaies liers, euill beaſts, and ſlow-bellies.</hi> And to conclude, they reſemble ſome of the Friers among the Papiſts; for as they are idle people and ſhaue their heads, ſo were the men of Creta. <hi>Titus (Pauls</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple) was a Biſhop in this Iſland, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote an Epiſtle to them, and to Nicapolis, and ſent it them aboue 320 miles. This Iſland in times paſt was very rich &amp; populous, for in it there was
100 townes; the chiefe of which were Gnoſſos, Cortyna, and Zydon, but Gnoſſos was the moſt principall and antienteſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in King <hi>Minos</hi> kept his court: in it the notable Geographer <hi>Strabo</hi> was borne.</p>
                  <p>This town of Gnoſſos in times paſt was called Ceratur, of the riuer Cerata which paſſeth by it; but now it and all the Iſland is called Candia. The Venetians euery three yeares appointed a new Duke to gouerne it. In this Iſland ſtood the townes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona and Laſſica, (by <hi>Pliny</hi> called Laſas) and in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two townes was the hauen of Gutfurt, whereof Saint <hi>Luke</hi> maketh mention in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles, cap.</hi> 27. ſaying,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:7153:283"/> That <hi>Paul</hi> counſailed the Saylers that were in the ſhip to anchor there, and ſtay the Winter ſeaſon in that Iſland: but the Captain of the ſhip gaue more credit to the Maſter of the ſhip, than to <hi>Pauls</hi> words, wherby in the end they were in danger of their liues. The townes of Salmona and Laſſica, with the hauen of Gutfurt, lay Southward in this Iſland, vpon the coaſt of the Mediterranean ſea: ſomewhat diſtant from them ſtood the towne of Aſſon, by <hi>Pliny</hi> called Aſum, where they hoiſed out their boate and ſayled Northward; and becauſe they had a faire South-winde, they thought to ſaile to Phoenicia, a hauen in Creta, but the winde comming about to the Eaſt, draue them backe againe into the ſea, by which meanes they were in danger of their liues.</p>
                  <p>This Iſland was brought vnder the ſubjection of the Romans 66 yeares before the birth of Chriſt, and ſo for a long time conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, vntill the Saracens entred therein, and tooke it from the Romans, 800 yeares after the birth of Chriſt. After that, in the yeare of our Lord 979, the Emperour of Conſtantinople draue the Saracens out of the Iſland, and kept it; but in the end the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians brought it vnder their ſubjection and ſeigniorie, in the yeare of our Lord
1202, and at this day it is called Candia.</p>

It is very pleaſant and fruitfull; bringing forth great plenty of Wheat, Rye, Flax, Comin, Cotton, Figs, Wine, Roſes, Violets, Tyme, Lauender, and many other ſweet and delightfull herbes from whence Bees did gather great plentie of honey. The Sunne is very hot in this Iſland, inſomuch that by the extreame feruor thereof, the inhabitants loſe their naturall complexion, and looke of a tawnie colour. In Summer euenings there falleth great plenty of dewes, whereby the earth is refreſhed, and the herbes increaſed. There is neither ſnow nor froſt ſeene in it, for the Northerne windes (which with vs are the authors of cold and froſts) with them procure raine, which greatly refreſheth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth the fruits of the earth; ſo that the paſtures and medowes become very pleaſant and full of graſſe: and although it be but 28 miles long, and 60 miles about, notwithſtanding it is very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous; for in the eight pariſhes that ſtand in this Iſle, there is numbred aboue twentie thouſand men.

The children that are borne in this country feare not any ſnakes, neither are hurt be any thing that is venomous, inſomuch that they will take Scorpions and eat them without danger, although in all other parts of the world thoſe kinde of creatures are moſt pernitious. In this Iſle alſo there are bred a kinde of Dogs that are but ſmall, yet very white and ſhagged, and ſo louing that the inhabitants of all the neighbouring countries will buy them, though they be at deare rates.</p>
                  <p>The chiefe citie thereof (called Malta) is ſo ſtrongly fortified
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:7153:284"/> both by art and nature, that it is almoſt impoſſible to be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, vnleſſe it be either by treaſon or famin. The tower or Caſtle thereof is fortified with the knights of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Order, who haue mightily expreſſed their valour and reſolution in defending this town from the Turks. About a mile from this, the ruins of a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faire city are to bee ſeene. And vpon the Eaſt promontorie, a little from the city of Malta, there yet remain the decaies (which are worthy to looke vpon) of a goodly temple dedicated to <hi>Iuno.</hi> It ſeems by what remaineth, that this church hath bin a fair and goodly thing in times paſt.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo here and there in the earth found certaine braſſe monies, hauing vpon the one ſide a ſuperſcription written in Greeke letters, and vpon the other the image of

<hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> the ruins of which are yet extant; and in it are found monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments worthy of admiration. At ſuch time as the Captaine of <hi>Maſſaniſſa</hi> King of the Numidians had conquered this Iſland, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other pretious things that he found in theſe Temples, he tooke thence a great deale of goodly Ivorie: but that religious King did faithfully reſtore all thoſe things backe again, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated them to the ſeuerall Temples. Thus we may perceiue that the inhabitants of this Iſle of Malta were wholly giuen to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and ſuperſtition, vntil ſuch time as <hi>Paul</hi> by the inconſtancy and vehemencie of the winde was driuen vpon it, and conuerted them from that peruerſe and prophane worſhip to the Chriſtian Religion, at ſuch time as he ſuffered ſhipwracke, and Wintered amongſt them, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.

<pb n="562" facs="tcp:7153:285"/> are Chriſtians, yet their ſpeech is much like the Saracens, which differeth little or nothing from the antient Punick. At ſuch time as <hi>Dido</hi> built Carthage (which is thought to be 890 years before Chriſt) <hi>Battus</hi> was King of this Iſle, and held a confederacy with <hi>Dido:</hi> for when <hi>Hyarbas</hi> King of the Gelutians made warre vpon <hi>Dido,</hi> becauſe he could not obtain her in matrimony, ſhe receiued ayd from this

<hi>Battus,</hi> and conquered the Iſland of Malta: ſo it continued in the juriſdiction of the Carthaginians a long time after, vntill the Carthaginians were conquered by the Romans; and then one <hi>Titus Sempronius</hi> (about ſuch time as <hi>Hannibal</hi> brought his army before Trebia) woon it, 217 yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt. And after it continued vnder the juriſdiction of the Romans 130 yeares, and then it was conquered by the Saracens; but they held it not long, for

All this city was compaſſed in with three walls, ſo ſtrong and ſo admirably fortified both by Nature and Art, that it oppoſed the Carthaginians in equall war. It was called Syracuſa, from draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſucking; and in proceſſe of time obtained the whole juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and gouernment of that Iſle; which was ſo well peopled in the time of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant, that he was able to make and maintaine an Army of one hundred thouſand foot, and twelue thouſand Horſe.

There alſo ſtood a Caſtle or Tower called by the name of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, which was ſo ſtrong, that when all the reſt of the Town was conquered, yet that maintained Warre for a long time.

For after hee was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and conſtrained to keepe a Schoole. Both theſe <hi>Dionyſians</hi> were learned men and great Philoſophers.

And who knowes not that the beginning of this City was meane, raiſed from a confuſed company, deſtitute both of ciuilitie, communitie, and lawes; yet hath it bin, and for the moſt part is the glory of the world, and the great commander of the Princes of the earth.</p>
                  <p>It was ſo called at firſt by <hi>Romulus</hi> (as <hi>Livy, lib.</hi> 1. ſaith) who firſt built it, ſeuen hundred fifty and one yeares before the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of Chriſt; being ſcituated vpon ſeuen hils, that is, Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolinus, Aventinus; Palatinus, Caelius, Exquilinus, Viminalis, and Quirinalis. But after, when the City was compaſſed about with walls, the hill Ianiculus was incloſed within it. The Vallies that lay between theſe hils were ſo raiſed vp with arches, vaults, and artificial mounts, that in proceſſe of time they became levell with the top of ſome of thoſe hills. It was beautified with faire and ſumptuous buildings; ſo that as it was the head of the world for command and power, in like like manner it exceeded all the reſt of the world for glory and riches, but principally for ſtately buildings. There were many goodly Temples, dedicated to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Apollo, Aeſculapius, Hercules, Diana, Iuno, Minerva, Lucia, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia, Fides, Pietas, Pax, Victoria, Iſis,</hi> beſides many other dedicated to other gods. But aboue all, that was the moſt ſumptuous that was called <hi>Pantheon deorum;</hi> at this day called the Church of All hallowes.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, here was to be ſeen the princely Edifices of Kings, Emperors, Conſuls, Senators, Patricians, and other Romans who were mighty in wealth and ſubſtance, built all of poliſhed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, beautified with gold and ſiluer; beſide palaces, bulwarks; the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres, triumphant arches, ſtatues, and ſuch like, al which were glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and greatly adorned the city. But aboue al theſe, the houſe of <hi>Nero</hi> was moſt worthy of obſeruation, which to ſee to was built all of burniſht gold very curiouſly wrought. Here alſo ſtood the monuments of the two <hi>Caeſars, Iulius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> alſo their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the one made of pure braſſe, the other of white marble. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there were many fruitfull orchards, water-courſes, &amp; whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome baths, brought thither by <hi>Antonius, Nero, Diocleſian,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Great.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="568" facs="tcp:7153:288"/>Alſo the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> erected many goodly churches for the vſe of the Chriſtians, &amp; indowed them with great means; and amongſt the reſt that which was dedicated to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> of Latteran, a faire and goodly Church, and for riches and curious workemanſhip might compare with the ſtatelieſt Temples that euer had beene in the world, moſt of the ornaments and images beeing made of Gold and Siluer: hee alſo erected the Vattican, which was dedicated to Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> and another holy houſe dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Saint
<hi>Paul;</hi> in either of which he placed their ſeueral ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres and monuments, beſtowing extraordinary coſt to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them. So many were the gifts and gratuites of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that they can ſcarce bee numbred: ſo that although the Emperour <hi>Trajan,</hi> and
<hi>Boniface</hi> the fourth, Pope of Rome, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great coſt to beautifie and adorne the city; yet were they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comparable to that which this Emperor did. Theſe things then beeing preſented to your viewe, you might iuſtly ſay, that Rome in her proſperitie and eminencie was the glory of the world: but as all eſtates are fickle and vncertain, ſtill ſubiect to varietie and change, ſo was this: firſt enuied of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the extreame oppreſſion of her gouernours; and after made deſolate by violence and force, all her former glorie beeing eclipſed, and the greateſt part of theſe goodly buildings layed leuell with the ground. Thus haue I ſhewed you what Rome was when it was in her proſperitie: It reſteth now to ſhew what Rome is.</p>
                  <p>Rome at this day differeth as much from the antient Rome, as the ſubſtance from the ſhadow. For although the Pope hath beautified and adorned the Weſt part of it with many faire and goodly buildings, and called it by the name of new Rome. Yet is it nothing comparable to the antient city, as it was when <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great were Emperours thereof, neither doth it ſtand in the antient place: for the firſt Citie ſtood vpon the Eaſt ſide of Tyber, this vpon the Weſt. The chiefe part of the other ſtood vpon the mountaines Capitolinus and Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, vpon which were the ſtately buildings of Senatours, Kings, and Emperors, but now they lie deſolate and waſte. The Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol alſo, and the Temple of
<hi>Iupiter Feretrius</hi> (goodly Buildings)
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:7153:288"/> beaten to the ground; onely ſome ruins, to ſhew that ſuch things there hath beene. And what now reſteth, that are worthie note, are in the commaund and power of the Pope: which are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; the moſt that can be named, are the Vattican, the tower of S.
<hi>Angelo,</hi> the Popes Pallace, his banquetting houſe, and the gardens and walkes about it; which are ſo well ſcituated, that they are a grace to all Rome, the reſt are but ordinarie and common buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Thus may you ſee that there is nothing in this world but hath a period, to which if with much labour it attaineth, then it commonly declineth, ſeldome continueth: for who knowes not with what labour, what perills by ſea, what dangers by land, through how many forreine warres and Domeſticke ſeditions, Rome was raiſed to her greatneſſe? And how ſuddenly was all this loſt? What the vertue and wiſedome of graue and reſolute Conſuls, Captaines, and Commaunders had with great hazard heaped vp; thruſting their Capitol and other Treaſuries ful, with the triumphant ſpoiles of forreine nations, was left to be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either by ſeditious ſouldiers or prodigall Emperours, and the State left as a prey to thoſe that were mightieſt: ſo that they were accounted moſt honourable, that with moſt injurie could get to themſelues either countenance to ouerſway authoritie, or opulency, to purchaſe eminency; inſomuch that there hath been no action ſo euill, nor any attempt ſo pernicious in former times, but may be matcht in the declining of the Romane ſtate. Where more murthers? where more corruption? where more oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than is mentioned in Hiſtories to bee practiſed amongſt the Romans? the liues of men, the ſtate of Prouinces, and the crowns of Kings ſold for money. But now her time is finiſhed, and her ruins are left for ſucceeding ages to admire; that ſo in beholding, they might learne to know the difference betweene vertue and vice; and from thence conclude, That there is nothing perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; and that thoſe things wherein men moſt glorie, doe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſooneſt decay. For if this citie which commanded the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; Princes of the earth (whoſe Colonies, Armies, Legions, confederacies, and treaſures, were ſo mightie, and extended ſo farre, that there was almoſt no countrey vnconquered, or nation
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:7153:289"/> that did not feare to heare the inhabitants therof named) is made deſolate and laid leuell with the ground: what then may be ſaid of pettie Cities, Townes, Lordſhips, Manors, and Houſes? ſhall not they likewiſe be ſubiect to the like calamities, &amp; waſted and deſtroyed through the continuance of time? Verily yea: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let not the king glorie in his power, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, nor the rich man in his riches: but let him that glorieth glorie in the Lord.</hi>
